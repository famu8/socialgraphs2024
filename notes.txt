Community Detection: we are interested in detecting communities of patients, for example to see if there is a certain community based on a network that links patients based on the medical treatment they receive and see if they are all readmitted.

Undirected. Unweighted networks.

We can get dendogram plots after the clustering

To find communities:
	- Girvan Newman - edge betweeness (
Undirected. Unweighted networks.)

To assess the goodness of the partitioning of the communities:
-	Modularity: a measure of how well the network is partitioned into communities. Useful for selecting the number of clusters. Dendogram and Modularity plot. 

Dividing graph into two groups:

	- Use spectral clustering. Use the eigenvectors/eigenvalues of a matrix representing the network. Adjancy matrix, Degree matrix,Laplacian Matrix are built from the graph. We decompose into Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors and Group. For multiple groups, methods of k-Way Spectral Clustering: Recursive Bi-partitioning or Cluster Multiple Eigenvectors (preferable).



TODO:

	- Most basic: Louvaine 

	- Spectral Clustering using Cluster Multiple Eigvenctors.

	- Test with modularity and compare between the two methods?

	- New stuff that is not in course: Test a different method for clustering the network and find a new measurement from modularity.
