100,Cinematronic ApS,Denmark,"Cinematronic is engaged in two ground-breaking product lines to significantly increase the viewer experience for audiovisual content via biometric user-reaction insights.

Firstly, we are developing a patent-pending interactive, adaptive media system.
A lot of content does not live up to users’ expectations, resulting in a loss of interest over time. Our system ensures a consistently high-quality user experience throughout the user’s media consumption. Besides making adaptable stories, the solution will become a fully automated quality assurance system. Using biosensors, the system detects the psychophysiological reaction of users and automatically adjusts the content based on their immediate needs. 

Moreover, we are working on Biometric Quality Assurance.
Conventionally, media production companies invest a significant amount of time and money in creating high-quality productions. Yet, this is not always a warranty for success. Quality assurance is often not used within the creative production phase but rather at the end of production when most of the financial and creative resources have already been spent.
