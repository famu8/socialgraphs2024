## Problem statement & motivation

- **Problem Statement**: The Danish startup ecosystem, renowned for its innovation and progressive policies, has seen significant growth in recent years, but the complex interactions within this network remain underexplored. Despite efforts to foster connections among startups, investors, and accelerators, limited data is available on how these entities influence each other in terms of resources, industry focus, and market influence. As the Danish ecosystem matures, understanding its internal dynamics becomes essential for policymakers, investors, and entrepreneurs aiming to strengthen its structure and global impact.

- **Motivation**: By mapping the Danish startup network through graph-based analysis, we can reveal clusters, hubs, and key pathways that drive growth and collaboration. This research will provide insights into which industries are most interconnected, identify potential synergies, and shed light on underrepresented areas within the ecosystem. This study ultimately aims to enhance transparency and guide resource allocation, paving the way for a more resilient and collaborative Danish startup landscape.
