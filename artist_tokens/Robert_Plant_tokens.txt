green area of halesowen worcestershire plant gained an interest in singing and rock and roll music at an early age in an interview with andrew denton on the denton talk show in 1994 plant stated his desire as a tenyearold to be like elvis presleywhen i was a kid i used to hide behind the curtains at home at christmas and i used to try and be elvis there was a certain ambience between the curtains and the french windows there was a certain sound there for a tenyearold which was all the ambience i got at ten years old and i always wanted to be a bit similar to thathe left king edward vi grammar school for boys in stourbridge in his midteens and developed a strong passion for the blues mainly through his admiration for willie dixon robert johnson and early renditions of songs in this genrei suppose i was quite interested in my stamp collection and romanibritish history i was a little grammar school boy and i could hear this kind of calling through the airwaveshe abandoned training as a chartered accountant after only two weeks to attend college in an effort to gain more gce passes and to become part of the english midlands blues scene i left home at 16 he said and i started my real education musically moving from group to group furthering my knowledge of the blues and of other music which had weight and was worth listening toplants early blues influences included johnson bukka white skip james jerry miller and sleepy john estes plant had various jobs while pursuing his music career one of which was working for the major british construction company wimpey in birmingham in 1967 laying tarmac on roads he also worked at woolworths in halesowen town for a short period of time he cut three obscure singles on cbs records and sang with a variety of bands including the crawling king snakes which brought him into contact with drummer john bonham they both went on to play in the band of joy merging blues with newer psychedelic trendsin 1968 guitarist jimmy page was in search of a lead singer for his new band and met plant after being turned down by his first choice terry reid who referred him to a show at a teacher training college in birmingham where plant was singing in a band named hobbstweedle in front of page plant sang jefferson airplanes somebody to love leading page to end his search as recalled by plant and pageplant i was appearing at this college when and jimmy turned up and asked me if id like to join the yardbirds i knew the yardbirds had done a lot of work in america – which to me meant audiences who would want to know what i might have to offer – so naturally i was very interestedpage when i auditioned him and heard him sing i immediately thought there must be something wrong with him personalitywise or that he had to be impossible to work with because i just could not understand why after he told me hed been singing for a few years already he hadnt become a big name yet so i had him down to my place for a little while just to sort of check him out and we got along great no problemswith a shared passion for music plant and page immediately developed a strong relationship and began their writing collaboration with reworkings of earlier blues songsinitially dubbed the new yardbirds in 1968 the band soon came to be known as led zeppelin the bands eponymous debut album hit the charts in 1969 and is widely credited as a catalyst for the heavy metal genre plant has commented that it is unfair for people to think of zeppelin as heavy metal as almost a third of their music was acousticin 1975 plant and his wife maureen now divorced were seriously injured in a car crash in rhodes greece this significantly affected the production of led zeppelins seventh album presence for a few months while he recovered and forced the band to cancel the remaining tour dates for the yearin july 1977 his son karac died at the age of five while plant was on led zeppelins concert tour of the united states plant retreated to his home in the midlands of england and for months afterward questioned his futureplant began writing song lyrics with led zeppelin during the making of led zeppelin ii in 1969 according to jimmy pagethe most important thing about led zeppelin ii is that up to that point id contributed lyrics robert hadnt written before and it took a lot of ribbing to get him into writing which was funny and then on the second lp he wrote the words of thank you he said id like to have a crack at this and write it for my wifeplants lyrics with led zeppelin were often mystical philosophical and spiritual alluding to events in classical and norse mythology such as immigrant song which refers to valhalla and viking conquests however the song no quarter is often misunderstood to refer to the god thor the song actually refers to mount thor which is named after the god another example is the rain songplant was influenced by j r r tolkien whose book series inspired lyrics in some early led zeppelin songs most notably the battle of evermore misty mountain hop no quarter ramble on and over the hills and far away contain verses referencing tolkiens the lord of the rings and the hobbit conversely plant sometimes used more straightforward blues themes dealing with sex as in the lemon song trampled under foot about giving in to sexual temptation and black dog narrated by a man obsessed with a womanwelsh mythology forms a basis of plants interest in mystical lyrics he grew up close to the welsh border and would often take summer trips to snowdonia plant bought a welsh sheep farm in 1973 and began taking welsh lessons and looking into the mythology of the land such as black book of carmarthen book of taliesin etc plants first son karac was named after the welsh warrior caratacus the song bronyaur stomp is named after the 18thcentury welsh cottage bronyraur owned by a friend of his father it later inspired the song bronyraur the songs misty mountain hop thats the way and early dabblings in what would become stairway to heaven were written in wales and lyrically reflect plants mystical view of the land critic steve turner suggests that plants early and continued experiences in wales served as the foundation for his broader interest in the mythologies he revisits in his lyrics including those myth systems of tolkien and the norsepages passion for diverse musical experiences influenced plant to explore africa specifically marrakesh in morocco where he encountered umm kulthumi was intrigued by the scales initially and obviously the vocal work the way she sang the way she could hold a note you could feel the tension you could tell that everybody the whole orchestra would hold a note until she wanted to changeboth he and jimmy page revisited these influences during their reunion album no quarter jimmy page and robert plant unledded in 1994 during his solo career plant tapped into these influences many times most notably on the 2002 album dreamlandmost of the lyrics of stairway to heaven from led zeppelin iv were written spontaneously by plant in 1970 at headley grange while the track was being recorded while never released as a single the song has topped polls as the greatest song of all timeplant enjoyed great success with led zeppelin throughout the 1970s and developed a compelling image as the charismatic rockandroll front man similar to his contemporaries the whos singer roger daltrey mick jagger of the rolling stones and jim morrison of the doors with his mane of long blond hair and powerful barechested appearance plant helped to create the god of rock and roll or rock god archetype on stage plant was particularly active in live performances often dancing jumping skipping snapping his fingers clapping making emphatic gestures to emphasise a lyric or cymbal crash throwing back his head or placing his hands on his hips as the 1970s progressed he along with the other members of led zeppelin became increasingly flamboyant onstage and wore more elaborate colourful clothing and jewelleryaccording to classic rock magazine once he had a couple of us tours under his belt percy plant swiftly developed a staggering degree of bravado and swagger that irrefutably enhanced led zeppelins rapidly burgeoning appeal in 1994 during his unledded tour with jimmy page plant himself reflected tongueincheek upon his led zeppelin showmanshipi cant take my whole persona as a singer back then very seriously its not some great work of beauty and love to be a rockandroll singer so i got a few moves from elvis and one or two from sonny boy williamson ii and howlin wolf and threw them all togetherone of the oddest awards he received was the rock scene magazine chest o rama readers of the magazine had to decide who had the best chest in rock and plant was the winner when they contacted him about it he replied im really greatly honoured although its hard for me to be eloquent on the subject of my chestafter led zeppelin disbanded in december 1980 following the death of drummer john bonham plant briefly considered abandoning music to pursue a career as a teacher in the rudolf steiner education system going so far as to be accepted for teacher training he nevertheless embarked on a successful solo career helped by encouragement from genesis drummer phil collins who would go on to play with him plants solo career began with the album pictures at eleven in 1982 followed by 1983s the principle of moments popular tracks from this period include big log a top 20 hit in 1983 in the mood 1983 little by little from 1985s shaken n stirred far post the bside of burning down one side which appeared on the soundtrack of the 1985 movie white nights starring gregory hines and mikhail baryshnikov and popularised by airplay on albumoriented rock stations tall cool one a no 25 hit from 1988s now and zen and later i believe from 1993s fate of nations this last track like led zeppelins all my love was written for and dedicated to his late son karac whilst plant avoided performing led zeppelin songs through much of this period although he would occasionally improvise his unique zeppelin screams into his set his tours in 1983 with phil collins on drums and in 1985 were very successful often performing to soldout arenasized venues in 1986 plant performed at the birmingham heart beat charity concert with other famous midlands musicians during the late 1980s and early 1990s plant cowrote three solo albums with keyboardistsongwriter phil johnstone these were now and zen in 1988 manic nirvana in 1990 and the 1993 fate of nations which features moya brennan of clannad and former cutting crew guitarist kevin scott macmichael songs from this third album plus a smattering of led zeppelin classics made up the setlist for plants acclaimed sunset performance on the main stage at glastonbury festival in 1993 it was johnstone who talked plant into playing led zeppelin songs in his live shows something plant

projects through this period including forming a shortlived allstar group with page and jeff beck in 1984 called the honeydrippers they released an ep called the honeydrippers volume one and the band
