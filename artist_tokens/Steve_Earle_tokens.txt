in 1990 earle stated in an interview about justice in ontario theres some concern about reprisals because the opp ontario provincial police is obviously not gon na be thrilled my hope is that ill be far too outintheopen and far too public for the police to do anything and get away with it but the point is thats not a reason for doing or not doing anything because…i very nearly went to prison myself for something i didnt do simply because a law enforcement agency didnt want to admit that somebody had fucked up—they didnt want to open the whole can of worms and all the other complaints that were constantly brought against the dallas police department you cant stand by and let stuff like that go down without saying anything about it and i think i especially have a responsibility to do that cause if i didnt have any money right now id be in prison in texas—im convinced of that it was that close but i was able to afford decent legal representation and it comes down to the fact that people who cant afford decent legal representation—who are subject to something like this happening and turning out very badly—feed my kids thats where my money comes from and thats where my freedom
