number two the albums production duties were split with don cook best known for his work with brooks dunn handling five tracks and lawrence and anderson on the other five brian wahlert of country standard time noted that the tracks produced by lawrence and anderson were more traditional country in their sound than the tracks cook produced highlighting is that a tear and somewhere between the moon and you as the strongest and most countrysounding cuts stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic wrote that the album was another crowdpleasing set of contemporary country like his previous albums the song selection is a hitormiss affair with about half of the songs failing to make much of an impression the remainder however proves why lawrence is one of the most popular singers in nashville in 1996 billboard ranked lawrence as the tenth mostplayed radio artist in any genre that yearlawrences fifth studio album the coast is clear was issued in march 1997 and achieved an riaa gold certification two months later like its predecessor it featured some songs produced by cook and others by lawrence and anderson this albums first two singles better man better off and how a cowgirl says goodbye both made top five on hot country songs but the followups were less successful the title track became his first single to miss the top 10 when it peaked at number 26 and while you sleep fell outside the top 40 tom roland of the tennessean noted that the album had a theme of attempts to undo whats done but criticized the sound as restrained and middleoftheroad sarah rodman of country standard time shared a similar opinion of the production calling while you sleep the most emotive and touching song while also referring to how a cowgirl says goodbye as lively atlantic issued a greatesthits package the best of tracy lawrence in 1998 this disc included thirteen previous singles and the new song her old stompin ground three years after its release this compilation received riaa gold certificationin late 1999 lawrence returned to the charts with lessons learned this was the lead single to his 2000 album of the same name which he and anderson produced with audio engineer butch carr the song reached number three on the country charts in 2000 and accounted for his highest hot 100 peak of number 40 the album charted two more singles in lonely and unforgiven tom roland gave lessons learned three out of five stars in a review for the tennessean noting that lawrence repeatedly sings of flaws and errors and the challenges in overcoming them erlewine wrote of the album in allmusic that it is certainly pleasant yet it tends to fade into the background jeffrey b remz of country standard time thought that the album maintained a constantly country sound and had wellwritten songsin late 2000 atlantic records closed its nashville division and moved all artists including lawrence to the nashville branch of parent company warner bros records his only release for that label tracy lawrence accounted for two lowcharting singles in life dont have to be so hard and what a memory lawrence and anderson produced the album and wrote several songs on it with other contributing writers including michael white casey beathard billy yates and frequent collaborator larry boone both country standard time and allmusic praised the album for having a more consistent and traditional sound than its predecessors with the formers scott homewood calling it quite possibly his best album and the latters liana jonas complimenting the lyrics of both singles along with the scaled down production allmusic biographer steve huey wrote of the album that despite some good reviews it failed to halt his downward commercial momentum lawrence also said that he felt that the label did not invest in promotion of the album due to a lack of interest in his musical style and direction as a result he began seeking out new producers in an attempt to reinvent self he considered buddy cannon byron gallimore and billy joe walker jr before choosing to reunite with stroud the two began recording for what would have been a second album for warner bros in 2002 but lawrence was dropped from the labels rosterafter being dropped from warner bros lawrence began seeking a new record deal he had considered rca records nashville but instead chose dreamworks records nashville of which stroud was then the president and signed a deal with them in october 2003 his first release for the label was paint me a birmingham which had been concurrently released by ken mellons on an independent label lawrences version overtook mellonss in terms of airplay reaching number four on hot country songs and number 42 on the hot 100 in early 2004 the corresponding album strong came out in 2004 and it consisted largely of material from the unreleased second project for warner bros nashville the albums followup singles its all how you look at it and sawdust on her halo were less successful at country radio lawrence noted that he had writers block when attempting to come up with material for the album and thus sought outside writers instead of his usual collaborators he described the title track about a divorced woman moving on with her life a different than anything ive done in the past while calling stones the most traditional song and noting the presence of story songs throughout he also noted that the album was almost titled stones but was renamed to avoid confusion with his debut album sticks and stoneserlewine wrote in allmusic that strong ranks among his smoothest albums a record dominated by ballads and where uptempo songs are as polished as the slow ones peter cooper of the tennessean thought that the album had betterwritten songs than its predecessors highlighting paint me a birmingham and sawdust on her halo in particular but criticizing the application of autotune to lawrences singing voice robert woolridge of country standard time thought that lawrences singing was stronger on the ballads such as paint me a birmingham as opposed to the more upbeat material but criticized the mainstream productionfollowing the closure of dreamworks nashville in 2005 lawrence transferred to mercury nashville that same year there he released the compilation then now the hits collection which included fifteen of his previous hits all of which except paint me a birmingham had to be newly recorded as the label did not own the rights to the original recordings made while he was on atlantic two new tracks were included as well both of which were released as singles a cover of mark neslers 1998 single used to the pain and if i dont make it back which was cowitten by bobby pinson of this compilation erlewine wrote these new versions are a little more laidback than the originals and theyre a little slicker too and while that doesnt necessarily suit lawrences voice which has grown a little thinner over the years that doesnt make then and now a bad listenin 2006 lawrence started his own record label rocky comfort records in partnership with his brother laney the first act signed to the label besides lawrence himself was chad brock lawrences first single for the label was find out who your friends are which was released in august 2006 from the studio album for the love the song initially lingered below the top 40 of the hot country songs charts but following the albums release it gained in radio interest due to the album containing as a bonus track an alternate version with tim mcgraw and kenny chesney on guest vocals thanks to the success of the alternate version find out who your friends are became a numberone single on that chart in 2007 the song reached that position in its 41st week on the chart setting a new record at the time for the slowest ascent to the top of the country charts and the secondslowest on any billboard chart the rerecorded version received musical event of the year honors at the
