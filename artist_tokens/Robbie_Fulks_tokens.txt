it gone away backward because its a phrase from the bible… i stumbled on the phrase later in the evolution of the record when i was looking around for a title i think its a nice piquant phrase that has three good strong mellifluous words in it as far as the backwardness of the record i think it goes backward in terms of nostalgia for the past – bittersweet nostalgia for the past – as well as the recession having knocked everything backwards for people in that sense its not an album about the past its an album about nowinterview with robbie fulks about gone away backwardby kim ruehl no
