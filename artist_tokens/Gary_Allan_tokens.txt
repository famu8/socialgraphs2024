tape in the glove box of a truck purchased by a wealthy couple when the couple discovered that he was the singer they wrote him a check for 12000 this independent funding allowed allan to go to

knowing that hill was lining up other labels to see allan decca asked them to cancel the second showcase a rep from rca was already booked to see the second showcase the following week but the
