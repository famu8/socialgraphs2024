morgan creek road which was sparsely populated taylor later said chapel hill the piedmont the outlying hills were tranquil rural beautiful but quiet thinking of the red soil caused by local copper mining plus the seasons the way things smelled down there i feel as though my experience of coming of age there was more a matter of landscape and climate than people james attended a public primary

north carolina before learning the guitar in 1960 his guitar style evolved influenced by hymns carols and the music of woody guthrie and his technique derived from his bass cleforiented cello training and from experimenting on his sister kates keyboards my style was a fingerpicking style that was meant to be like a piano as if my thumb were my left hand and my first second and third fingers were my right hand spending summer holidays with his family on marthas vineyard he met danny kortchmar an aspiring teenage guitarist from larchmont new york the two began listening to and playing blues and folk music together and kortchmar felt that taylors singing had a natural sense of phrasing every syllable beautifully in time i knew james had that thing taylor wrote his first song on guitar at 14 and he continued to learn the instrument effortlessly by the summer of 1963 he and kortchmar were playing coffeehouses around the vineyard billed as jamie kootchin 1961 taylor went to milton academy a preparatory boarding school in massachusetts he faltered during his junior year feeling uneasy in the highpressure college prep environment despite having a good scholastic performance the milton

joined a band formed by his brother alex called the corsayers later the fabulous corsairs playing electric guitar in 1964 they cut a single in raleigh that featured jamess song cha cha blues on the

selective service system when he appeared before them uncommunicative with two whitesuited mclean assistants taylor earned a high school diploma in 1966 from the hospitals associated arlington school he later viewed his ninemonth stay at mclean as a lifesaver like a pardon or like a reprieve and both his brother livingston and his sister kate later were patients and students there as well as for his mental health struggles taylor thought of them as innate and said its an inseparable part of my personality that i have these feelingsat kortchmars urging taylor checked himself out of mclean and attended elon university for a semester before he moved to new york city to form a band they recruited joel obrien formerly of kortchmars old band king bees to play drums and taylors childhood friend zachary wiesner son of academic jerome wiesner to play bass after taylor rejected the notion of naming the group after him they called themselves the flying machine they played songs that taylor had written at and about mclean such as knocking round the zoo dont talk now and the blues is just a bad dream in some other songs taylor romanticized his life but he was plagued by selfdoubt by summer 1966 they were performing regularly at the highvisibility night owl cafe in greenwich village alongside acts such as the turtles and lothar and the hand peopletaylor associated with a motley group of people and began using heroin to kortchmars dismay in a late 1966 hasty recording session the group cut a single taylors night owl backed with his brighten your night with my day released on rainy day records distributed by jubilee records it received some radio airplay in the northeast but only charted at no 102 nationally other songs had been recorded during the same session but jubilee declined to go forward with an album after a series of poorly chosen appearances outside new york culminating with a threeweek stay at a failing nightspot in freeport bahamas for which they were never paid the flying machine broke up a uk band with the same name emerged in 1969 with the hit song smile a little smile for me the flying machine was briefly referenced in taylors song fire and rain and following his success as a solo artist the bands recordings were later released in 1971 as james taylor and the original flying machinetaylor would later say of this new york period i learned a lot about music and too much about drugs indeed his drug use had developed into fullblown heroin addiction during the final flying machine period i just fell into it since it was as easy to get high in the village as get a drink he hung out in washington square park playing guitar to ward off depression and then passing out letting runaways and criminals stay at his apartment finally out of money and abandoned by his manager he made a desperate call one night to his father isaac taylor flew to new york and staged a rescue renting a car and driving all night back to north carolina with james and his possessions taylor spent six months getting treatment and making a tentative recovery he also required a throat operation to fix vocal cords damaged from singing too harshlytaylor decided to try being a solo act with a change of scenery in late 1967 funded by a small family inheritance he moved to london living in various areas notting hill belgravia and chelsea after recording some demos in soho his friend kortchmar gave him his next big break kortchmar used his association with the king bees who once opened for peter and gordon to connect taylor to peter asher asher was ar head for the beatles newly formed label apple records taylor gave a demo tape of songs including something in the way she moves to asher who then played the demo for beatles paul mccartney and george harrison mccartney remembers his first impression i just heard his voice and his guitar and i thought he was great and he came and played live so it was just like wow hes great taylor became the first nonbritish act signed to apple and he credits asher for opening the door to his singing career taylor said of asher who later became his manager i knew from the first time that we met that he was the right person to steer my career he had this determination in his eye that i had never seen in anybody before 70 living chaotically in various places with various women taylor wrote additional material including carolina in my mind and rehearsed with a new backing band taylor recorded what would become his first album from july to october 1968 at trident studios at the same time the beatles were recording the white album mccartney and an uncredited george harrison guested on carolina in my mind whose lyric holy host of others standing around me referred to the beatles and the title phrase of taylors something in the way she moves provided the lyrical starting point for harrisons classic something mccartney and asher brought in arranger richard anthony hewson to add both orchestrations to several of the songs and unusual link passages between them they would receive a mixed reception at bestjames had been through so much by the time he was twenty that he had so much to express in his music other young artists of his age whom i worked with sang about how good or bad life was but really had no idea what they were singing about james was already singing with the conviction of a singer much older than himself everything that he had already been through was evident in his songwriting—peter asher taylors manager 66 during the recording sessions taylor fell back into his drug habit by using heroin and methedrine he underwent physeptone treatment in a british program returned to new york and was hospitalized there and then finally committed himself to the austen riggs center in stockbridge massachusetts which emphasized cultural and historical factors in trying to treat difficult psychiatric disorders meanwhile apple released his debut album james taylor in december 1968 in the uk and february 1969 in the us critical reception was generally positive including a complimentary review in rolling stone by jon landau who said that this album is the coolest breath of fresh air ive inhaled in a good long while it knocks me out the records commercial potential suffered from taylors inability to promote it because of his hospitalization and it sold poorly carolina in my mind was released as a single but failed to chart in the uk and only reached no 118 on the us chartsin july 1969 taylor headlined a sixnight stand at the troubadour in los angeles on july 20 he performed at the newport folk festival as the last act and was cheered by thousands of fans who stayed in the rain to hear him his set at newport was cut short after 15 minutes when festival cofounder george wein announced on stage that the apollo 11 astronauts had landed on the moon shortly thereafter taylor broke both hands and both feet in a motorcycle accident on marthas vineyard and was forced to stop playing for several months however while recovering he continued to write songs and in october 1969 signed a new deal with warner bros recordsonce he had recovered taylor moved to california keeping asher as his manager and record producer in december 1969 he held the recording sessions for his second album there titled sweet baby james and featuring the participation of carole king the album was released in february 1970 and was taylors critical and popular breakthrough buoyed by the single fire and rain a song about both taylors experiences attempting to break his drug habit by undergoing treatment in psychiatric institutions and the suicide of his friend suzanne schnerr both the album and the single reached no 3 on the billboard charts with sweet baby james selling more than 15 million copies in its first year and eventually more than 3 million in the united states alone sweet baby james was received at its time as a folkrock masterpiece an album that effectively showcased taylors talents to the mainstream public marking a direction he would take in following years it earned several grammy award nominations including one for album of the year it went on to be listed at no 103 on rolling stones 500 greatest albums of all time in 2003 with fire and rain listed as no 227 on rolling stones 500 greatest songs of all time in 2004during the time that sweet baby

fire and rain and country road on february 17 1971 his career success at this point and appeal to female fans of various ages piqued tremendous interest in him prompting a march 1 1971 time magazine cover story of him as the face of new rock it compared his strongbutbrooding persona to that of wuthering heights heathcliff and to the sorrows of young werther and said taylors use of elemental imagery—darkness and sunlight references to roads traveled and untraveled to fears spoken and left unsaid—reaches a level both of intimacy and controlled emotion rarely achieved in purely pop music one of the writers described his look as a cowboy jesus to which taylor later replied i thought i was trying to look like george harrisonreleased in april 1971 mud slide slim and the blue horizon also gained critical acclaim and contained taylors biggest hit single in the us a version of carole kings new youve got a friend featuring backing vocals by joni mitchell which reached no 1 on the

walking man was released in june and featured appearances of paul and linda mccartney and guitarist david spinozza the album was a critical and commercial disaster and was his first album to miss the top 5 since his contract with warner it received poor reviews and sold only 300000 copies in the united states the title track failed to appear on the top 100however taylors artistic fortunes spiked again in 1975 when the gold album gorilla reached no 6 and provided one of his biggest hit singles a version of marvin gayes how sweet it is to be loved by you featuring wife carly on backing vocals and reached no 5 in america and no 1 in canada on the billboard adult contemporary chart the track also reached the top and the followup single the feelgood mexico featuring a guest appearance by crosby nash also reached the top 5 of that list a wellreceived album gorilla showcased taylors electric lighter side that was evident on walking man however it was arguably a more consistent and freshersounding taylor with songs such as mexico wandering and angry blues it also featured a song about his daughter sally sarah mariagorilla was followed in 1976 by in the pocket taylors last studio album to be released under warner bros records the album found him with many colleagues and friends including art garfunkel david crosby bonnie raitt and stevie wonder who cowrote a song with taylor

favorable to the album of which he wrote in its august 11 1977 issue jt is the least stiff and by far the most various album taylor has done thats not meant to criticize taylors earlier efforts but its nice to hear him sounding so healthy jt reached no 4 on the billboard charts and sold more than 3 million copies in the united states alone the albums triple platinum status ties it with sweet
