lead her but she could lead me too following the workshop white and williams made immediate plans to meet again they wrote the song falling during their first session which took place at williams houselooking for a name for the project williams came up with the civil wars which has no historical meaning but rather is based on the quote be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle attributed to ian maclaren according to williams as i was thinking about the music we make that sense of battle seemed applicable the duo performed for the first time as the civil wars at the french quarter cafe in nashville on april 7 2009 williams former producer charlie peacock was in attendance and impressed by their dynamics and onstage chemistry began working with them the following day on
