all 11 songs on their first album twice the speed of life all three worked on the lead single baby girl bush described the experience as his second first record understanding the experience and knowing the pressure associated with the first attempt the trio treated the album like a side project to their other musical endeavors but understood the potential of it over time the songs were written roughly around 2001 in a notably dark period of bushs life in light of the downfall of billy pilgrim the death of his mother and the recent september 11 attacks he wrote songs that were lighthearted and depicted a life that he wanted to live they found success performing live in knoxville and bush bought his first cowboy hat on ebay in 2003 to prove to his friends he was taking the new endeavor seriously they eventually received the attention of mercury nashville in 2004 and landed a recording deal with them to release an albumsugarland broke through in 2004 with the release of

dressing room felt the quake and witnessed flying debris break down the stage door and fill the hallway he had thought a bomb went off in the immediate aftermath of the collapse he nettles and other crew downstairs were not allowed to leave crew members attempted to leave but were kept from doing so bush was unaware of what happened and was kept in the dark for a long time he was eventually evacuated to his bus but was forced to remain on the scene he recalled all sorts of silence as nettles and the downstairs crew watched footage of the accident on the news bush wrote the following on their sugarland websiteour fans just came to see a show and it ended in something terrible my heart is totally broken for the families and friends of those who lost their lives it ’ s broken for all the people who got hurt for the people who were scared i thank god for every person who lifted a truss who pushed against that metal to get it off someone for every person who used a chair as a stretcher i thank god for every fan and emergency responder for everyone who ran to the trouble instead of away from it the courage of those men and women will forever be with mein years following especially the immediate days following the event bush was discouraged from talking about the accident due to pending lawsuits sugarland cancelled one upcoming concert and performed two more concluding the incredible machine tour in october 2011sugarland announced they would be going on hiatus for a few months to consider their next steps forward bush returned home and continued working out the details of his pending divorce finalizing it in november 2011 in light of the stage collapse and what talking about it publicly would mean for his children he refrained from openly discussing the divorce as well within the same month nettles got married and informed bush that she was pregnant and that she wanted to do a solo album since she wanted more time to experience new things and focus on her familythe two agreed to put the band on hiatus indefinitely fulfilling their preestablished plans bushs final performance as sugarland before the hiatus was at mandalay bay resort and casino on september 2 2012 without the band bushs schedule was completely empty which he found anxietydriving unsure of what to do going forward bush purchased a house in nashville and began reaching out and working with established songwriters in the area accepting any work that was offered to him unable and struggling to freely discuss his circumstances he began expressing himself through songwriting bush mainly wrote music only when he needed to for sugarland but now found himself writing songs constantlyyou could hear me but i couldnt tell youkristian bush discussing his circumstances and southern gravity 2015 the tennessean interviewbush was encouraged by the people around him to write a solo album at first he was reluctant to do so believing that doing so would hurt the image of sugarland byron gallimore sugarlands producer ensured him that since he was never the primary singer of the band he wouldnt replace sugarland on country radio he began considering the venture and looked through what songs he had written following the hiatus he was surprised to find he had a collection of 300 recorded songs and focused on what collection of songs he should release first he began playing and writing for those he had worked with in the past although they were reluctant to give him an opportunity because they did not know anything about how he performed separately he realized then that the momentum from sugarland would not carry over into his potential solo careerin july 2013 after being drawn to the music and design of the mobile app my singing monsters while watching his son play he expressed his praise of the game on twitter the games director dave kerr responded suggesting a collaboration and bush agreed performing the mandolin for a monster representation of himself the shugabush the following october bush was invited to perform at the inaugural c2c country to country festival at the o2 arena in london england the trip inspired him to release a song as a single to play there resulting in his solo debut with the song love or money performed with a full band the entire audience sang the chorus back to him the song released in the united states on october 10 2013 my singing monsters would later feature a cover of love or money with bush doing a gibberish rendition of the lyrics bush also hosted music mondays on his website where he released his works and discussed the story behind it he found himself writing and recording music much more frequently purposefully not thinking about where or when the song would be released on average he was making about 160 songs a yearwe wanted to start with a story that embodied the greatness and power of country music his studio burned down his mom passed and he gathered the fortitude to keep going that ’ s really where sugarland came from when you bring in the success that is sugarland this tragedy of the indiana state fair stage collapse then he went on another journey after that — what you end up with is great music and this kind of epic journey of a guy who loves making musicstokes nielson director and producer of walk tall the journey of sugarlands kristian bushin 2014 bush signed for gallimores streamsound records as a solo artist gallimore noticed that bush was hiding a lot when it came to his current situation and recognized that it was a very very painful time for him two songs on the album southern gravity and trailer hitch was written with tim owens owens said that given the kind of person that bush is and his talent of writing positive music he was not surprised he could write happy songs that sound marginally like sugarland despite him being in a dark place many songs from his backlog were shelved for being too sad and outside the scope of music he wanted to release the solo album consisted of feelgood music and lyrics bush himself admitted that he was unsure how that came to be given the circumstances in an interview with the tennessean bush said i think i write wishes if you can see it you can probably get there my story starts now he had a lot of selfdoubt at the time believing that the songs werent any good because he conceived them too easily he collaborated with the best in his field to ensure people werent showing positive reception simply because he was famous including will jennings paul overstreet bob dipiero
