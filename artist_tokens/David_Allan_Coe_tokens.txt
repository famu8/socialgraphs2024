written including billie jo spears 1972 recordings souvenirs california memrys and tanya tuckers 1973 single would you lay with me in a field of stone which was a no 1 hit and responsible for coe becoming one of nashvilles hottest songwriters and coe himself being signed by columbia records coe recorded his own version of the song for his second columbia album once upon a rhyme released in 1975 allmusic writer thom jurek said of the song the amazing thing is that both versions are definitiveunlike coes first two albums his third showed full commitment to country music and coe would play a part in the evolution of what would become known as outlaw country the title of coes third album the mysterious rhinestone cowboy refers to the gimmick coe adopted several years before glen campbell had a hit with the song rhinestone cowboy dressing up in a rhinestone suit and wearing a lone ranger mask the singer later recalled to michael buffalo smith in 2004 i guess i have to blame it on mel tillis i met him when i first went to nashville and he had an office down on music row i was over there talking to him in his office and he opened up the closet to get something and he had a whole closet full of rhinestone suits i just freaked out on that he looked at me and said you like that shit i dont even wear those if you want em take em he gave me those rhinestone suits and i wore them everywhere coe maintained the idea for the mask came from his father then i got the mysterious rhinestone thing from my father he asked me you know the only way that the lone ranger can go into town i said no i dont know what you mean he said that he has to take his mask off i thought what is my dad talking about and trying to tell me he said well son you have to wear a mask and then when you dont want to be david allan coe you can take your mask off and go anywhere and not be like elvis with people messin with you all the timecoes second album once upon a rhyme contains one of his biggest hits you never even called me by my name written by steve goodman and john prine and which first appeared on goodmans 1971 debut release coes version became his first country top 10 hit single peaking at no 8 in 1975 and includes a spoken epilogue where coe relates a correspondence he had with goodman who stated the song he had written was the perfect country and western song coe wrote back stating that no song could fit that description without mentioning a laundry list of clichés mama or trains or trucks or prison or getting drunk goodmans equally facetious response was an additional verse that incorporated all five of coes requirements and upon receiving it coe acknowledged that the finished product was indeed the perfect country and western song and included the last verse on the recordwell i was drunk the day my mom got out of prisonand i went to pick er up in the rainbut before i could get to the station in my pickup truckshe got runned over by a damned ol traincoe was a featured performer in heartworn highways a 1975 documentary film by james szalapski other performers featured included guy clark townes van zandt rodney crowell steve young steve earle and the charlie daniels band coe also wrote cocaine carolina for johnny cash and sang background vocals on the recording that appeared on cashs 1975 album john r cashby 1976 the outlaw country movement was in full swing as artists such as waylon jennings and willie nelson were finally enjoying massive commercial success after years of fighting to record their music their own way coe however was still somewhat an outsider almost too outlaw for the outlaws a predicament summed up well by allmusichis wild long hair multiple earrings flashy glitzy rhinestone suits harley davidson biker boots and footballsized belt buckles had become obstacles to getting people to take him seriously as a recording artist other singers continued to record and succeed with his material but he himself – who was as good a singer as almost anyone and better than most – languished in obscurity rather than tone it down coe characteristically shoved the stereotypes in their faces he retired the mysterious rhinestone cowboy persona and billed his new album as david allan coe rides again as the longhaired redneck something equally offputting to institution typeslonghaired redneck was coes third album for columbia in three years and the first where he wrote or cowrote all the songs the outlaw country zeitgeist was summed up well in the title track which recounts playing in a dive where bikers stare at cowboys who are laughing at the hippies who are praying theyll get out of here alive the song features coe impersonating the vocal styles of ernest tubb bill anderson and merle haggard about the term longhaired redneck coe later said it was terminology that id made up at the time i was trying to tell people that not everybody with long hair was a hippie not everyone was the kind of person that thought you could punch them out take their money and that theyd say i wont do nothin about itby 1977 the outlaw movement was nearing its apex having seen the release of willie nelsons blockbuster album red headed stranger and country musics first platinum selling album wanted the outlaws coe considered himself as integral as anyone in the evolution of the outlaw country genre and began saying so in his music as noted in allmusics review of the album on rides again by trying to make a conscious outlaw record and aligning himself with the movements two progenitors on the opening track willie waylon and mecoe already set up selfparody unintentionally – something that continued to curse him the songs on rides again crossfade without the usual silences between tracks which was unusual for country music and feature coes heavily phased guitar coe was also permitted to use his own band on several tracks a major concession for columbia at the time however some of his peers resented coe placing himself in such exalted company and felt he was exploiting his relationship with his fellow outlaws jennings drummer richie albright called coe a great great songwriter a great singer but he could not tell the truth if it was better than a lie hed made up waylon didnt make him comfortable enough to hang around but willie did i was around willie quite a bit and david allan was with him eighty percent of the time willie allowed him to hang around coe managed to maintain friendships with both jennings and nelson despite the formers cool treatment of him at times in his autobiography jennings mentions coe once in a chapter titled the outlaw shit calling him the most sincere of the bunch of bandwagon jumpers but contends when it came to being an outlaw the worst thing he ever did was doubleparking on music row addinghe wrote a song called waylon willie and me at the same time he started taking potshots at us in interviews saying that willie and kris had sold out that i was running around wearing white buck shoes and none of us were really an outlaw he was the only outlaw in nashvillei saw him in fort worth and i put my finger right up to his chest you got ta knock that shit off i told him i aint never done anything to you he protested they just set us upyou know i love you waylonhe could drive me crazy but there was something about david that pulled at my heartstringsthroughout the rest of the decade coe released a string of strong recordings some of which such as human emotions 1978 and spectrum vii 1979 were concept albums with each side of the discs given their own theme 1978s family album contains coes rendition of take this job and shove it a song he composed and which had been released by johnny paycheck in october 1977 becoming a monumental success the song is a first person account of a man who has worked for fifteen years with no apparent reward and it struck a chord with the public even inspiring a 1981 film of the same name although coes name was credited the assumption by many was that paycheck an acclaimed songwriter himself composed the tune this would feed into coes growing bitterness with the industry as another one of his peers exploded in popularity coe was further disenchanted when pop star jimmy buffett accused him of plagiarising his hit changes in latitudes changes in attitudes for coes divers do it deeper coe had been incorporating caribbean sounds into his music as is evident on his 1979 album compass point by 1980 coe and producer billy sherrill set out to reach a wider audience and bring coe back to the charts by inviting other singers and musicians to take part in the sessions for what would become ive got something to say which would boast contributions from guy clark bill anderson dickey betts from the allman brothers band kris kristofferson larry jon wilson and george jones this process was continued the following year on invictus means unconquered with sherrill couching the songs in tasteful instrumentation that put the spotlight squarely on coes voice in his allmusic review thom jurek labelled it arguably the finest album of his careerby 1981 the outlaw country movement waned as the slicker urban cowboy era took hold in country music typified by the johnny lee hit lookin for love which critic kurt wolff panned as an example of watereddown cowboy music coe was an important figure in the outlaw country genre but judging by the sound of his recordings from this period he had no interest in the trendy urban cowboy phase refusing to give into the flavorofthemonth generic country talent coe stuck to what he knew and sharpened the edges however while scoring some moderate hits mainstream success remained elusive coes highest charting single during this period was get a little dirt on your hands a duet with bill anderson which peaked at no 45 as if aware of the compromises he had been making coe chose to close out his 1982 album dac with a suite of three songs that contained a short prologuemakin records is uh somethin thats kind of hard for me to do because im an entertainer so i made my mind up a few albums ago that i was gon na do so many songs for the record company and so many for myselfweve turned the lights down low in the studio and the musicians have thrown away their little cheat sheets so this is for all you david allan coe fans thats been with me for a long time who didnt really care if i got played on the radio or notcastles in the sand would be a huge comeback for coe peaking at no 8 on the country albums chart his highest showing since once upon a rhyme hit the same mark eight years earlier its success was spurred on by the ride which was released in february 1983 as the lead single from the album and reached no 1 on the june 4 cashbox country singles chart it spent 19 weeks on the billboard country singles charts reaching a peak of no 4 and hitting no 2 on the canadian rpm country tracks chart the ballad tells the firstperson story of a hitchhikers encounter with the ghost of hank williams sr in a ride from montgomery alabama to nashville tennessee the mysterious driver dressed like 1950 half drunk and holloweyed questions the narrator whether he has the musical talent and dedication to become a star in the country music industry the songs lyrics place the events on us route 31 or the largely parallel interstate 65 buoyed by the single castles in the sand became the mainstream breakthrough that coe and producer billy sherrill had been trying for since the decade began 1984s just divorced contains coes second biggest chart hit mona lisa lost her smile which rose to no 2 on the billboard country singles chart and no 3 on cashbox in canada it reached no 1 on the rpm country tracks charts dated for june 30 1984 the song is a midtempo ballad about a young blonde girl featuring allusions to the iconic da vinci painting the song features one of producer billy sherrills most elaborate productions with one critic commenting the layered strings and organ work are slick but they add such warmth and depth in contrast to coes voice that it works to devastating effect another track missin the kid finds a father lamenting the loss of his daughter who now lives with his estranged exwife over a languid beat and using simple language coe delivers a stunning vocal that expresses with weary resignation the bitterness guilt and extreme sadness that comes with a broken family beginning with the line i still cant believe after all of these years i still miss you the narrator wonders what his wife will tell their daughter when she asks about him and finally declaresin his allmusic review of the album writer thom jurek writesmissin the kid is a selfpenned waltz that is sad and haunted full of regret and remorse over the loss of his daughter when his second marriage broke up something he never got over its also one of the most sensitive things hes ever written as it is full of empathy for a daughter he hasnt seen in over ten yearsshe used to love me a lot was released in december 1984 and peaked at no 11 on both the us billboard hot country singles chart and the canadian rpm country tracks chart a version of the song by johnny cash was recorded in the early 1980s but remained unreleased until 2014 the song tells of a chance meeting between two exlovers at the silver spoon café but when the man tries to rekindle the romance she dismisses him in the same cavalier way he did her years earlier it was written by dennis morgan charles quillen and kye fleming as coe who continued to write songs of high quality nonetheless relied on outside writers to get him in the charts the 1986 album son of the south would include contributions from fellow outlaw legends nelson jennings and jessi colter his final recording for columbia the concept album a matter of life…and death was released in 1987in 1990 coe reissued his independent albums nothing sacred and underground album on compact disc as well as the compilation 18 xrated hits throughout the 1990s coe had a successful career as a concert performer in the united states and europe in 1999 coe met pantera guitarist dimebag darrell in fort worth texas and the two musicians struck by the similarity of the approaches between country and heavy metal agreed to work together and began production on an album in 2000 coe toured as the opening act for kid rock and the new york times published an article by journalist neil strauss who described the material on nothing sacred and underground album as among the most racist misogynist homophobic and obscene songs recorded by a popular songwriter coe maintains that he wrote to strauss during the writing of the article but the journalist did not acknowledge any interaction between the two only stating that coes manager refused to speak on the recordin 2003 coe wrote a song for kid rock single father which appeared on kid rocks selftitled album and was released as a single which peaked at number 50 on the billboard country singles chart rebel meets rebel with dimebag darrell vinnie paul and rex brown recorded sporadically between 1999 and 2003 was released in 2006 two years after darrells murder allmusic described it as a groundbreaking country metal albumin the 2006 video gods gon na cut you down coe introduces johnny cash as the man in black the video directed by tony kaye was released in connection with cashs cover of the song in american v a hundred highwaysin 2017 he was featured singing take this job on the album baptized in bourbon by the moonshine bandits he also sings in the videocoes integrity was called into question after his previous claim that he had spent time on death row for killing an inmate who tried to rape him was debunked when a texas documentarian discovered coe had done time for possessing burglary tools and indecent materials – but never murder criticisms such as these notwithstanding coe always maintained he was integral to the outlaw country movement getting its name stating in 2003…the truth is that waylon and willie nelson and i played at an outdoor festival called 48 hours in atoka in oklahomawhen we got thereseveral women were raped and people stabbed there was a lot of alcohol and drugs or whatever i told my band dont worry about it well provide our own protection at that time i was in the outlaws motorcycle club i had my outlaws colors on i had my pistol in my pocket and i rode my motorcycle up on stage while waylon was singing i got off my motorcycle and went out and started singing with waylon and then willie came out and sang with us there was a picture of us in the paper that had an arrow pointing to the pistol in my pocket and another arrow pointing to where it said outlaws florida the headline said the outlaws came to town thats actually how it all started coe was uncompromising when it came to his lifestyle and language even though it kept him off country playlists and award shows for example the house weve been calling home from the 1977 album rides again explores the theme of polygamy me and my wives have been spending our lives in a house weve been calling a home while on the final cut on the album if that aint country ill kiss your ass coe utters a racial slur on record for the first time singing the line workin like a nigger for my room and board the song paints a picture of a texas family that verges on caricature with the narrator describing his tattooed father as veteran proud and deeming his oldest sister a firstrate whore the song further alienated coe from the country mainstream and kickstarted accusations that he was a racist a charge he always vehemently denied in 2004 he remarkedi am a songwriter you know and to me it has always bothered me that actors in the movies can say whatever they want to say kill people rape people and do things and no one ever accuses them personally of being that way but when you write a song and then all of a sudden you are being accused of something to me songwriting is painting a picture and all you have to work with is wordsi grew up with all my life hearing lazy as a mexican stingy as a jew working like a nigger or dumb as a polack its stereotype stuff that you hear growing up that immediately puts a picture in your headthe cover of the 1986 release son of the south which displayed coe holding a baby with a confederate flag draped over his shoulders galled many industry insiders although coe did print a message on the back of the album to defuse any potential backlashi was born in akron ohio and i moved to the south when i was in my early twenties which made me a yankee rebel son i am not against anything or any place or any nationalities regardless of what youve heard about me there are two things i am very proud of one of them is my son tyler who is my first born son and the other is my personal relationship with god i am proud of that relationship as i am proud that my son was conceived in nashville tennessee and he is truly a son of the southin another interview coe said anyone that would look at me and say i was a racist would have to be out of their mind i have dreadlocks down to my waist with earrings in both ears and my beard is down to my waist and it is in braidsi was in prison with 87 black people i hung around with black people and i learned to sing music with black people it was ironic that in prison the white guys called me a nigger lover and now i write the word nigger in a song and i am all of a sudden a racist it is pretty ironicwhile coe lived in key west shel silverstein played his comedy album freakin at the freakers ball for coe spurring him to perform his own comedic songs for silverstein who encouraged coe to record them leading to the production of the independently released nothing sacred jimmy buffett accused coe of plagiarizing the melody of divers do it deeper from buffetts changes in latitudes changes in attitudes stating i would have sued him but i didnt want to give coe the pleasure of having his name in the paper in response to the success of buffetts song coe wrote a song insulting buffett and it appeared on nothing sacred the album was released by mail order in 1978 through the back pages of the biker magazine easyriderscoes 1979 columbia album spectrum vii contained a note stating jimmy buffett does not live in key west anymore a lyric from a song from nothing sacred the albums songs are profane often sexually explicit and describe an orgy in nashvilles centennial park and sex with pornographic film star linda lovelace the album also contains a song targeting anita bryant a musician notable for her strong opposition to lgbt rights specifically her fight to repeal an lgbt antidiscrimination ordinance in miamidade county in the song bluntly titled fuck aneta briant coe calls out bryant as being hypocritical for her opposition to the lifestyles of gay people stating that in fact anita bryant some act just like youin 1982 coe released another independent album underground album which contained his most controversial song nigger fucker written from the perspective of a man whose lover left him for an african american man the sexually explicit song resulted in coe being accused of racism primarily because of this song the material recorded by singer and white supremacist johnny rebel has also been mistakenly attributed to coe allmusic which did not review underground album gave it three out of five stars coe responded to the accusations by saying anyone that hears this album and says im a racist is full of shit coes drummer kerry brown is black and married to a white woman brown is the son of legendary blues musician clarence gatemouth brown when asked about coes xrated albums brown stated david allan coe was controversial some of the songs are really out there but its my life when you live in the david allan coe world you learn to be controversiallike willie nelson and jerry lee lewis coe has battled the irs costing him the publishing rights to his compositions including take this job and shove it he stated in 2003all of my songs up to 1984 were sold in a bankruptcy proceeding for like 25000 from the bankruptcy court because nobody told me theyd been put up for sale basically the irs claimed i owed them 100000 i was living at a place and we had a flood and everything was destroyed they knew i didnt have any records – any proof of what i did have and what i didnt have so i just filed bankruptcy nelson chose to deal with them i chose not to im totally straight with them now the only income i have is the money i make on the road performing and from my new songs that i ownin another interview coe added all the songs on the xrated albums were sold i dont own that stuff anymore i have nothing to do with that stuff they have to give me credit as the songwriter but i dont make one centcoes musical style derives from blues rock and country music traditions his vocal style is described as a throaty baritone his lyrical content is often humorous or comedic with william ruhlmann describing him as a nearparody of a country singer stephen thomas erlewine describes coe as a great unashamed country singer singing the purest honkytonk and hardest country of his era he may not be the most original outlaw but there is none more outlaw than himcoes lyrics frequently include references to alcohol and drug use and are often boisterous and cocky coes debut album penitentiary blues was described as voodoo blues and redneck music by allmusics thom jurek it focused on themes such as working for the first time blood tests from veins used to inject heroin prison time hoodoo imagery and death the albums influences included charlie rich jerry lee lewis bo diddley lightnin hopkins and tony joe white coe later explained to kristofer engelhardt of review i didnt really care for some of the country music until people like kris kristofferson and some of those people started writing songs they had a little more to say than just oh baby i miss you or whatever i dont do anything halfway once i got into country music i went back and researched it and learned everything there was to know about it i could do impersonations of roy acuff ernest tubb hank snow marty robbins just about anybody i knew just about all there was to know about country musiccoes first country album the mysterious rhinestone cowboy has been described as altcountry prepunk and a hillbilly version of marc bolans glitz and glitter credited influences on the album include merle haggard in his early career coe was known for his unpredictable live performances in which he would ride a harleydavidson motorcycle onto the stage and curse at his audience coe has also performed in a rhinestone suit and a mask which resembled that of the lone ranger calling himself the mysterious rhinestone cowboydespite accusations of racism for the content of some of his song lyrics coes psychedelic concept album requiem for a harlequin 1970 saw coe honoring the birth of soul music ranting against the kkk and commiserating with other children of the concrete jungle in what phoenix new times described as coes black panther audition tape and a stab at radical chic and his later album rebel meets rebel featured a song cherokee cry which criticizes the united states governments treatment of native americans when asked why he did not write more political songs coe replied i live in my own world not thee world i just write songs about what affects me in everyday life at one point i wrote a song that was sort of a protest about when they were talking about drafting women into the military it was about my son making it past the draft but my daughter didnt and ive done farm aidin his review of coes 1987 album a matter of lifeand death allmusics thom jurek wrote coe may have had some hits but it is records like this that make one wonder if there was not a conspiracy to marginalize him and make him fail coe is a brilliant songwriter well into the 21st century and deserves to be lauded along with the likes of nelson and jennings and kristofferson and newbury – and even cash
