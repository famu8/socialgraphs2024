at the university of alberta noted the number of tributes to lightfoot in the media that held him as quintessentially canadian and questioned whether this nationalist nostalgic view the reality that lightfoot was a musician who had a much wider influence on the popular music scene of the 1970s well beyond canada ’ s borders carpenter contended that lightfoot both romanticized canadian history and looked more deeply into the countrys past – an aspect of his music that has been largely lost in the effusive eulogies in the media lightfoots gentle sentimental delivery style was noted by carpenter as evoking a nostalgia but this was not necessarily a compelling or accurate portrait of canada with the article concluding simply casting lightfoot as an exemplar of canadianness overshadows

understand the feelings that you lack is altered to im just trying to understand the feelings that we lack he said in an interview that the difficulty with writing songs inspired by personal stories

relationships between his first and second marriages gaylen mcgee and eric lightfootin the early 1970s lightfoot was involved with cathy smith their volatile relationship inspired his songs sundown
