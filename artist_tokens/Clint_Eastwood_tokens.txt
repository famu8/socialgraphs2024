insisted eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the mask he was attempting to create for the charactera fistful of dollars proved a landmark in the development of spaghetti westerns with leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns and challenging american stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero the films success made eastwood a major star in italy and he was rehired to star in for a few dollars more 1965 the second of the trilogy through the efforts of screenwriter luciano vincenzoni the rights to for a few dollars more and

you can minutes later confusion among the crew over the word vaya resulted in a premature explosion that could have killed wallachi wanted to play it with an economy of words and create this whole feeling through attitude and movement it was just the kind of character i had envisioned for a long time keep to the mystery and allude to what happened in the past it came about after the frustration of doing rawhide for so long i felt the less he said the stronger he became and the more he grew in the imagination of the audiencethe dollars trilogy was not released in the united states until 1967
