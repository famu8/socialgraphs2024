bill haley his comets was an american rock and roll band formed in 1947 and continuing until haleys death in 1981 the band was also known as bill haley and the comets and bill haleys comets from late 1954 to late 1956 the group recorded nine top 20 singles one of which was number one and three that were top ten the single rock around the clock was the bestselling rock single in the history of the genre and maintained that position for several yearsband leader bill haley had previously been a western swing performer after recording a rockabilly version of ike turner and his kings of rhythms rocket 88 one of the first rock and roll recordings haley changed his bands musical direction to rock music they went on to record hit versions of crazy man crazy shake rattle roll the aforementioned rock around the clock dim dim the lights rockabeatin boogie razzledazzle see you later alligator the saints rock n roll and rip it up in 1956 the group appeared in two early rock and roll movies with disc jockey alan freed rock around the clock and dont knock the rockthough the group was considered to be at the forefront of rock and roll during the genres formative years the arrival of more risqué acts such as elvis presley and little richard by 1956 led the more cleancut haley and his comets to decline in popularity haley would remain popular in europe and go on to have a comeback as a nostalgia act in the 1970s along with many of his contemporaries following haleys death no fewer than seven different groups have existed under the comets name all claiming with varying degrees of authority to be the continuation of haleys group as of the end of 2014 four such groups were still performing in the united states and internationallyin around the mid1940s bill haley performed with the down homers and formed a group called the four aces of western swing the group that later became the comets initially formed as bill haley and the saddlemen c 1949–1952 and performed mostly country and western songs though occasionally with a bluesy feel the group was also the first to record a cover version in july 1951 of rocket 88 originally a jump blues song by jackie brenston and his delta cats who were actually ike turner and his kings of rhythm he did so for the philadelphiabased holiday records label in what is now recognized as a rockabilly style it sold well and was followed in 1952 by a cover of a 1940s rhythm and blues song called rock the joint for holidays sister company essex recordsduring those years however haley was considered one of the top cowboy yodelers in america many saddlemen recordings were not released until the 1970s and 1980s and highlights included romantic ballads such as rose of my heart and western swing tunes such as yodel your blues away the original members of this group were haley pianist and accordion player johnny grande and steel guitarist billy williamson al thompson was the groups first bass player followed by al rex and marshall lytle during the groups early years it recorded under several other names including johnny clifton and his string band and reno browne and her buckaroos although browne a female matinee idol of the time did not actually appear on the recordrocket 88 rock the joint and their immediate followups were released under the increasingly incongruous saddlemen name it soon became apparent that a new name for the group was needed to fit the new musical style a friend of haleys making note of the common mispronunciation of the name halleys comet to rhyme with bailey suggested that haley call his band the comets this event is cited in the haley biographies sound and glory by john haley and john von hoelle bill haley by john swenson and in still rockin around the clock a memoir by comets bass player marshall lytlethe new name for the group was adopted in the fall of 1952 before the 1953 release of crazy man crazy which had some elements of rock and roll and rockabilly music members of the group at that time were haley johnny grande billy williamson and marshall lytle grande usually played piano on records but switched to accordion for live shows as it was more portable than a piano and easier to deal with during musical numbers that involved a lot of dancing around soon after renaming the band haley hired his first drummer earl famous displeased with the lineup haley sought out dick boccelli also known as dick richards who turned down the job but recommended a young drummer charlie higler soon after haley asked richards again who then accepted the role during this time and as late as the fall of 1955 haley did not have a permanent lead guitar player choosing to use session musicians on records and either playing lead guitar himself or having williamson play steel soloseven before the release of more successful records the group had achieved greatness in some respects no one had blended country and rb on a single before the comets rock the joint no one had scored an american top 20 hit with anything that could really qualify as rocknroll before their single crazy man crazy in 1953in 1953 haley scored his first national success with his original song crazy man crazy a phrase haley said he heard from his teenage audience again released on essex haley later claimed the recording sold a million copies but this is considered an exaggeration some sources indicate that the recording—a blend of rb western and pop music—is a contender for the title of first rocknroll record while others state that it was merely the first rock and roll song to be a hit on the pop charts it was also said to be the first rocknroll recording to be played on national television in the united states in an episode of omnibus american tv program in 1953on their last release from essex new band member joey ambrose is heard on the bside straight jacketin the spring of 1954 haley and his comets left essex for new yorkbased decca records where they were placed under the auspices of veteran producer milt gabler who would produce all of the bands recordings for the label and who had been involved in creating many protorock and roll recordings by the likes of the andrews sisters and louis jordan dating back to the 1940s one of jordans records saturday night fish fry 1949 is considered to be a contender for the title of first rockn roll record gabler later commented that all the tricks i used with louis jordan i used with bill haleythe groups first session on april 12 1954 yielded rock around the clock which would become haleys biggest hit and one of the most important records in rock and roll history sales of rock around the clock started slowly since it was the bside of the single but it performed well enough that a second decca session was commissionedshake rattle and roll followed a somewhat bowdlerized cover version of the big joe turner recording released earlier in 1954 the single was one of deccas bestselling records of 1954 and the seventhbestselling record in november 1954in 1954 anita gordon starred in round up of rhythm a film short in which she and disc jockey bill delzell played straight jacket and shake rattle and roll which the group are seen playingin march 1955 the group had four songs in cash box magazines top 50 songs dim dim the lights i want some atmosphere birth of the boogie mambo rock and shake rattle and rollhaleys shake rattle and roll never achieved the same level of historical importance as rock around the clock but it predated it as the first international rock and roll hit it did not attain the number 1 position on the american charts but it became haleys first gold record elvis presley recorded the song in 1956 combining haleys arrangement with turners original lyrics but his version was not a substantial hit late in 1954 haley recorded another hit dim dim the lights which was one of the first rb songs recorded by a white group to cross over to the rb charts johnnie ray had reached number 1 with cry in 1952the belated success of rock around the clock is attributed to its use in the soundtrack of the film blackboard jungle which was released on march 19 1955 the song was rereleased to coincide with the film and shifted to the singles aside haleys recording became an anthem for rebellious 1950s youth and reached number 1 on the pop charts remaining there for eight weeks and went to number 3 on the rb chart according to the guardian the group was the first rocknroll band and the song was particularly important because it was the first rocknroll record heard by millions of people worldwideambroses acrobatic saxophone playing along with lytle on the double bass – literally on it riding it like a pony and holding it over his head – were highlights of the bands live performances during this time their music and their act were part of a tradition in jazz and rhythm and blues but it all came like a thunderclap to most of their audience in late 1954 haley and his comets appeared in a short subject entitled round up of rhythm performing three songs this was the earliest known theatrical rock and roll film releasein 1955 lytle richards and ambrose quit the comets in a salary dispute and formed their own group the jodimars haley hired several new musicians to take their place rudy pompilli on sax al rex a former member of the saddlemen on double bass and ralph jones on drums in addition lead guitarist franny beecher who had been a session musician for haley since danny cedrones death in the spring of 1954 became a fulltime comet and haleys first performing lead guitarist cedrone had played the guitar solo on the original recording of rock around the clock and died shortly after the recording session for shake rattle and roll in the summer of 1954 this version of the band became more popular than the earlier manifestation and appeared in several motion pictures over the next few yearsother hits recorded by the band included see you later alligator in which haleys frantic delivery contrasted with the louisiana languor of the original by bobby charles dont knock the rock rockabeatin boogie rudys rock the first instrumental hit

by milton berle on may 31 1955 berle predicted that the song would go to number 1 calling the band a group of entertainers who are going right to the top berle also sang and danced to the song which was performed by the entire cast of the show this was one of the earliest nationally televised performances by a rock and roll band and provided the new musical genre a much wider audiencebill haley

bands popularity in the united states began to wane in 1956–57 as sexier wilder acts such as elvis presley jerry lee lewis and little richard began to dominate the record charts although haleys cover version of little richards rip it up released in direct competition with little richards original recording outsold the original after skinny minnie hit the charts in 1958 haley had little further success in the united states although a spinoff group made up of comets musicians dubbed the kingsmen no relation to the later group of louie louie fame had a hit with an instrumental weekend that same yearoverseas however haley and his band continued to be popular touring the united kingdom in february 1957 when haley and his crew were mobbed by thousands of fans at waterloo station in london at an incident which the media dubbed the second battle of waterloo the group also toured australia in 1957 and in 1958 enjoyed a successful if riotdominated tour of the european mainland bill haley his comets were the first major american rock and roll act to tour the world in this way elvis who was on military duty in germany visited them backstage at some shows on a free day in berlin they performed two songs in the caterina valente movie hier bin ich hier bleib ich here i am here i stayback in the us haley attempted to start his own record label clymax and establish his own stable of performers notably sally starr the hostess of a philadelphia television childrens program and the matys brothers members of the comets were commissioned to work as session musicians on many of these recordings many of which were written or cowritten by haley and members of the comets the clymax experiment only lasted about a year in 1959 haleys relationship with decca collapsed after a final set of instrumentalonly recordings in the fall haley announced he was leaving decca for the new warner bros records label which released two more albums in 1960 which were moderately successful in 1960

unexpected hit with twist español a spanishlanguage recording based on the twist dance craze which was sweeping america at the time haley followed up with florida twist 3 mex according to billboard hits of the world 042162 which was for a time the biggestselling single in mexican history although chubby checker and hank ballard were credited with starting the twist craze in america in mexico and latin america bill haley and his comets were proclaimed the kings of the twist thanks to the success of twist español and florida twist among others the band had continued success in mexico and latin america over the next few years selling many recordings of spanish and spanishflavored material and simulated live performances overdubbed audience over studio recordings on the orfeon label and its subsidiary dimsa they hosted a television series orfeon a gogo and made cameo appearances in several movies lipsynching some of their old hits haley who was fluent in spanish recorded a number of songs in the language but most of the bands output during these years was instrumental recordings many utilizing local session musicians playing trumpet there was also some experimentation with haleys style during this time one single for orfeon was a folk ballad jimmy martinez which haley recorded without the cometsin 1966 the comets without bill haley cut an album for orfeon as session musicians for big joe turner who had always been an idol to haley no joint performance of shake rattle and roll was recorded however in a 1974 interview with bbc radio haley said turners career was in a slump at this time so he used his thenconsiderable influence with orfeon to get turner a recording session the comets association with orfeondimsa ended later that yearby 1967 as related by haley in an interview with radio host red robinson in that year the group was a free agent without any recording contracts at all although the band continued to perform regularly in north america and europe

single for the united artists label a version of tom t halls thats how i got to memphis but no longterm association with the label resulted in order to revive his recording career haley turned to europeby the late 1960s haley and the comets were considered an oldies act the bands popularity never waned in europe the group signed a lucrative deal with sonet records of sweden in 1968 and recorded in a new version of rock around the clock which hit the european charts that year the band recorded a mixture of live and studio albums for the label over the next decadein the united states

square garden in new york city haley received an eightandahalfminute standing ovation following his performance as nader related in his recorded introduction to haleys live album bill haley scrapbook which was recorded a few weeks later at the bitter end club in new yorkthe band appeared in several concert films in the early 1970s including the london rock and roll show for which haleys 1960–66 lead guitarist john kay briefly rejoined the band and let the good times roll after 1974 tax and management problems prevented haley from performing in the united states so he performed in europe almost exclusively though he also toured south america in 1975 the band was also kept busy in the studio recording numerous albums for sonet and other labels in the 1970s several with a country music flavor in 1974 haleys original decca recording of rock around the clock hit the american sales charts once again thanks to its use in the film american graffiti and for two years on the television program happy daysin february 1976 haleys saxophone player and best friend rudy pompilli died of cancer after a nearly 20year career with the comets haley continued to tour for the next year with a succession of new sax players but his popularity was waning again and his 1976 performance in london was critically lambasted in the music media such as melody maker that year the group also recorded an album rock at muscle shoals sound studio for sonet records according to one source he had conflicted feelings about fame was extremely private suffered chronic alcoholism and troubled relationships having admitted to an alcohol problem in a 1974 radio interview for the bbc haley continued to battle alcoholism into the 1970s in early 1977 haley announced his retirement from performing and settled down at his home in mexico according to the john swenson biography of haley the musician was quoted as saying that he and pompilli had an agreement that if one died the other would retirethe comets continued to tour on their own during this periodin 1979 haley was persuaded to return to performing with the offer of a lucrative contract to tour europe an almost completely new group of musicians mostly british including saxophonist pete thomas were assembled to perform as the comets haley appeared on numerous television shows and in the movie blue suede shoes filmed at one of his london concerts in march 1979 a few days later a performance in birmingham was videotaped and aired on uk television it was released on dvd in 2005 during the march tour haley recorded several tracks in

deathon november 26 1979 haley and the comets performed for queen elizabeth ii a moment haley considered the proudest of his career it was also the last time he performed in europe and the last time most fans saw him perform rock around the clockhaley made his final performances in south africa in may and june 1980 just before the south african tour commenced haleys health was reportedly failing and he was reportedly diagnosed with a brain tumor a planned tour of germany in the autumn of 1980 was subsequently cancelled the tour was critically lambasted but surviving recordings of a performance in johannesburg show haley in good spirits and good voice nonetheless according to the haley news fan club newsletter and the haley biography sound and glory planned concerts such as a fall 1980 tour of germany and proposed recording sessions in new york and memphis were cancelled including a potential reunion with past members of the cometsdespite his illness haley started compiling notes for possible use as a basis for either a biographical film based on his life or a published autobiography accounts differ and there were plans for him to record an album in memphis tennessee when the brain tumor began affecting his behavior and he returned to his home in harlingen texas the october 25 1980 issue of german tabloid bild reported that haley had a brain tumor haleys british manager patrick malynn was quoted as saying that haley had taken a fit didnt recognize anyone anymore in addition a doctor who examined haley said that the tumor was inoperable haleys widow martha who was with him in these troubling times denied he had a brain tumor as did his close friend hugh mccallum martha and friends related that haley did not want to go on the road anymore and that ticket sales for that planned tour of germany in the fall of 1980 were slow mccallum said its my unproven gut feeling that that was said to curtail talks about the tour and play the sympathy cardhaley returned to his home in harlingen texas at this time haleys alcoholism appeared to be worsening according to martha by this time she and haley fought all the time and she told him to stop drinking or move out eventually he moved into a room in their pool house martha still took care of him and sometimes he would come in the house to eat but he ate very little there were days we never saw him said his daughter martha maria in addition to haleys drinking problems it was becoming evident that he was also developing serious mental health issues martha maria said it was like sometimes he was drunk even when he wasnt drinking after being picked up by the police in harlingen several times for alleged intoxication martha had a judge put haley in the hospital where he was seen by a psychiatrist who said haleys brain was overproducing a chemical like adrenaline the doctor prescribed a medication to stop the overproduction but said haley would have to stop drinking martha said this is pointless she took him home however fed him and gave him his first dose as soon as he felt better he went back out to his room in the pool house and the downward spiral continued until his deathmedia reports immediately following his death indicated that haley displayed deranged and erratic behavior in the final weeks of his life according to a biography of haley by john swenson released in 1982 haley made a succession of bizarre mostly monologue latenight phone calls to friends and relatives toward the end of his life in which he was semicoherent his first wife has been quoted as saying he would call you and ramble dwelling on the past the biography also describes haley painting the windows of his home black but there is little other information available about his final dayshaley died in his sleep of an apparent heart attack on february 9 1981 at the age of 55 at his home in harlingen texas he was discovered lying motionless on his bed by a friend who had stopped by to visit him the friend immediately called the police and haley was pronounced dead at the scene haleys death certificate gave natural causes most likely a heart attack as the cause of death following a small funeral service attended by 75 people haley was cremated in brownsville texasin april 1981 bill haley his comets returned to the british musical charts once again when mca records inheritors of the decca catalogue released haleys golden medley a hastily compiled edit of the bands bestknown hits in the style of the thenpopular stars on 45 format the single reached number 50 in the uk but was not

comets this dates back to lane and rappa during a period when they worked together as one band winning a trademark infringement lawsuit against the aforementioned joey rand group in 1989 both rappas and lanes bands have from time to time recruited other former comets for their lineups for example in 2005 rappa joined forces with joey welz but for the most part the bandleaders are the only regular
