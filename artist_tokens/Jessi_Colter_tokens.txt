at no 5 on the billboard country chart and no 57 on the pop chart the singles bside you aint never been loved like im gon na love you charted among the top pop 100 also in 1975a survey of industry sources reveals that capitol was releasing both you aint never been loved and whats happened to blue eyes as simultaneous singles for the pop and country markets the confusion in marketing was made evident when programmers were uncertain of which single to play both sides of the same record scored on the pop top 100 but whats happened to blue eyes powered into the country top 5 capitol clearly recognized that a miscalculation had occurred and subsequently purchased fullpage industry ads saying weve flipped whats happened to blue eyes is the single it was too little too late with two competing singles marketed to radio capitols risky move made certain that colter would not naturally followup the success of im not lisa in the pop top 40the second single was nevertheless a huge countrypop success and later that year colter launched a nationwide tour as part of waylon jennings program at the santa monica civic auditorium in 1976 colter released her second and third capitol studio albums jessi and diamond in the rough both albums were as successful as colters 1975 album both debuting at no 4 on the top country albums chart the lead single from her jessi album its morning and i still love you was a top 15 country hit in 1976 on the country charts her second album that year diamond in the rough produced only one charting single i thought i heard you calling my name at this point colter had established herself as a bigselling albums artist rather than a casual honkytonk hitmaker given that her talents were far more inclined to soulrock than to mundane country music
