serious challenge to the established nfl and he had a choice to be a top pick in either leagueyoung was selected by the usfl los angeles express in the first round 11th overall of the 1984 draft held that january express general manager don klosterman told young that if he signed with the express his head coach would be john hadl a former allpro quarterback who had shepherded john elway through his first year in the nfl klosterman also told young that hall of fame coach sid gillman who had been hired as a consultant would tutor him on how to be a pro quarterbackthe regular 1984 nfl draft would not be held until may to help influence his decision the express offered an allsports record 10year 40 million contract young was convinced and signed with the express in march 1984 he agreed to take his payment in the form of an annuity paid out over forty years to help the fledgling teamafter missing the first six games of his rookie season while taking some college classes in order to graduate on time young started the final 12 games he had a respectable year highlighted by becoming the first pro football player ever to pass for 300 yards and rush for 100 in a single gamedespite a roster which included such future nfl players as jojo townsell mel gray and kevin nelson and making the western conference title game in youngs first season the express were never able to create a sustaining fan base in los angeles they often played to sparse crowds that looked even more so in the 95000seat los angeles memorial coliseumnear the end of the 1984 season express owner j william oldenburg was forced to give up control of the team after multiple reports revealed he had misrepresented his net worth houston gamblers minority owner jay roulier was cleared to buy the team only to be pushed out shortly before the 1985 preseason when it emerged that he too had lied about his finances for all intents and purposes the express 1985 season ended at that point the league took over the team and cut the budget to the bare minimum notably no money was allocated to replace injured players this left the express in a precarious position when a rash of injuries decimated the roster even before then young and the other young players concluded that the express would not be around for the planned move to a fall schedule in 1986 even if the usfl survived with this in mind they played tentatively so as not to harm their nfl prospects as a result despite fielding essentially the same team as a year prior the express cratered to a 3–15 recordbefore the express final home game — which had been moved to los angeles pierce college in the san fernando valley — the bus driver refused to leave unless he was paid up front in cash young contributed some money as did the team trainer and the driver took them to the game in the season finale at orlando young had to line up at tailback because the express had no healthy running backs left on the rosterit was reported that young had insured his contract and would still be paid until 2027 however facing the prospect of both a faltering owner and an unstable league young had already renegotiated his 10year deal down to 4 years and had already collected a total of 48 million of the 58 million due in toto through the final year of that deal in 1987 working out to an annual rate of pay of 24 million for his first two seasons that was the highest in all of american sports included in that negotiation was a payment of 14 million for the balance of the 10year annuity less money paid out against it and salaries for the remaining two years of the deal in excess of 450000 annually according the usfl commissioner then overseeing the la express which had fallen into receivershipyoung grew increasingly dissatisfied with the disarray surrounding the express just a week before what proved to be the last usfl title game young gave the usfl an ultimatum – find a new owner for the express or allow him to buy out his contract and go to the nfl soon after the league decided to suspend the expresss operations for the 1986 season young bought out his express contract and signed with the tampa bay buccaneers who had made him the first pick in a supplemental draft of usfl and cfl players a year earlierby this time the buccaneers were in the midst of what would be 12 consecutive 10loss seasons they posted identical 2–14 records in youngs two seasons with them going 3–16 with him as a starter young threw for only 11 touchdowns with 21 interceptions while completing fewer than 55 of his passesthe buccaneers selected university of miami quarterback vinny testaverde first overall in the 1987 nfl draft because young was deemed a bust young was traded to the san francisco 49ers on april 24 1987 to serve as a backup to joe montana 49ers coach bill walsh was impressed by youngs natural abilities and believed his lackluster numbers were primarily due to the lack of talent around him in tampa baythe buccaneers received second and fourth round draft picks in the trade which they used to draft miami linebacker winston moss and arizona state wide receiver bruce hill respectivelyyoung played behind montana for four years but shone as a backup substituting for an injured montana early in the first quarter of a 1987 game against the chicago bears young threw four touchdown passes in a 41–0 victory in their 1987 divisional playoff game against the minnesota vikings he replaced montana in the second half after the team fell behind 27–10 the 49ers still lost the game but young had a good performance completing 12 of 17 pass attempts for 158 yards a touchdown and an interception while also leading san francisco in rushing with 72 yards and a touchdown on six carries on october 30 1988 young ran for a 49yard gamewinning touchdown against the minnesota vikings he started the game out with a 73yard touchdown pass to john taylor after montana went down with an injury the play earned the 49ers a 24–21 victory and a bit of revenge on the vikings for their previous seasons playoff loss the win turned out to be crucial without it the 49ers would have finished the season 9–7 and missed the playoffs two other teams in their division the los angeles rams and new orleans saints had 10–6 records instead the 49ers won their division earned the 2 playoff seed and went on to win the super bowlin 1989 young displayed potential to become the teams starter in the future while montana won the nfl mvp award and led the team to a victory in super bowl xxiv young still had a good season completing 69 of his passes for 1001 yards eight touchdowns and only three interceptions on october 22 1989 he posted a perfect passer rating of 1583 when he completed 11 of 12 passes for 188 yards and three touchdown passes in a 37–20 victory over the new england patriotsyoung rushed for a careerhigh 102 yards on just eight carries against the new orleans saints on december 23 1990 making him only the second 49ers quarterback to rush for at least 100 yards in a single game the 49ers lost the game 13–10in his four seasons as a backup young threw 23 touchdown passes and only six interceptionsfollowing an injury to montanas elbow in the 1990 nfc championship game which forced him to miss the entire 1991 season young got his chance to lead the 49ers but got off to a rough start midway through the season the 49ers found themselves struggling with a 4–4 record in the ninth game of the season after throwing a franchiserecord 97yard touchdown pass to taylor young suffered a knee injury and was replaced by backup quarterback steve bono after a loss in that game and the next bono led the 49ers to five consecutive victories playing so well that coach george seifert decided to keep him in the starting lineup after young had recovered it was not until late in the 15th game of the season after bono went down with an injury of his own that young got to play again young then closed out the season by throwing for 338 yards and three touchdowns and also rushing for 63 yards and another touchdown in a 52–14 win over the chicago bears in a monday night football game at candlestick parkyoung finished the season with an nfl best 1018 passer rating despite missing five full games and most of a sixth he still threw for 2517 yards 17 touchdowns and only eight interceptions despite youngs strong season the season for the team was widely regarded as a disappointment the 49ers had slipped from a 14–2 record in the previous season to a 10–6 record in 1991 10 wins while usually being enough to grant a playoff spot for a team kept the 49ers just short of the playoffs and san francisco ended up not playing in the postseason for the first time since 1982 it was thought by many that youngs days as the 49ers starter were numbered due to the impending return of montana from the injury to his right elbow and some observers said the 49ers should trade young and keep montana and bono however the trade never happenedby the start of the 1992 season it appeared that youngs starting job was in serious peril in addition to having to compete with bono montana appeared to be close to recovering from his elbow tendon surgery san francisco came close to trading young to the los angeles raiders but no deal was finalized and it turned out that montana would not recover in time to start in the opening game montana would not return until the final game of the 1992 season a monday night home game against the detroit lions montana played the entire second half of that final game and guided the 49ers to victoryyoung ended up as san franciscos starting quarterback but once again got off to a rough start on the fifth play of the opening game at the new york giants he suffered a concussion and was replaced by bono who threw two touchdown passes while leading the 49ers to a 31–14 victory the following week the 49ers lost 34–31 to the buffalo bills despite a careerhigh 449 passing yards and three touchdowns from young in a game that for the first time in nfl history had zero punts from either teamyoung recovered and led the 49ers on a fivegame winning streak capped off by a 56–17 victory over the atlanta falcons in which he passed for 399 yards and three touchdowns after missing most of the next game a 24–14 loss to the cardinals with the flu young led san francisco to a victory in all of their remaining games of the season giving the team a 14–2 record he went on to throw for 227 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 73 yards in a 20–13 divisional playoff win over the washington redskins however the 49ers lost the nfc championship game 30–20 to the eventual super bowl champion dallas cowboys young threw for 313 yards completing 714 of his passes while passing for a touchdown and rushing for another however he also threw two interceptions but the final one came with the outcome of the game already decidedyoung finished the season with 3465 passing yards and 537 rushing yards along with an nflbest 25 touchdown passes and 1070 passer rating earning him the nfl most valuable player award and his first selection to the pro bowl young was the first quarterback ever to record a tripledigit rating in consecutive seasons many credit his turnaround to the mentoring of the 49ers new offensive coordinator mike shanahan who worked with young on combining his running skill with onthemove passing decisionsbefore the start of the 1993 season team owner eddie debartolo jr announced that he wanted montana to resume his role as starting quarterback for the 49ers however a rift in the locker room had developed with players split on whom they wanted at quarterback in the spring of 1993 at montanas request san francisco traded montana to the kansas city chiefs young was now the 49ers undisputed starter and would remain so for the rest of his career but once again young had a rough start to the season over the first four games of 1993 young who was hindered by a swollen thumb on his throwing hand threw eight interceptions more than he had thrown during the entire 1992 season but after his thumb healed young went on an incredible streak over a span of seven games throwing 16 touchdown passes with only two interceptions and a 1222 passer rating by the end of the year young set franchise records for most passing yards 4023 and consecutive passes thrown without an interception 189 later eclipsed by alex smith in 2012 while leading the nfl in touchdown passes 29 and passer rating 1015 the team slipped to a 10–6 record but advanced to the nfc championship game again by blowing out the new york giants 44–3 in the divisional round however they were again defeated by the dallas cowboys this time 38–21after several key free agent signings including allpro cornerback deion sanders and nfl draft selections the 49ers looked to win their first super bowl since 1989 they started fast beating the los angeles raiders 44–14 on the strength of four touchdown passes from young one of four games during the regular season in which he had at least four after a loss in a muchanticipated game to joe montana and the kansas city chiefs the 49ers won their next two games before losing to the philadelphia eagles 40–8 at candlestick park a game in which young was eventually benched in the middle of an offensive series although head coach george seifert later said he only pulled young because he was getting manhandled by the eagles defense young had had enough of being scapegoated for 49er shortfalls and loudly and visibly lambasted seifert over his decision while standing on the sideline during the game is this great or what i mean i havent thrown six touchdown passes in a game in my life then i throw six in the super bowl unbelievablesteve youngbut the game was considered a turning point in the season from there young led the team to 10 consecutive wins by an average of 20 points before losing the meaningless finale against the vikings in which young completed his first 12 of 13 attempts before going to the sidelines they finished an nfl best 13–3 securing homefield advantage throughout the nfc playoffs the 49ers had the numberone offense in the nfl and were so dominant that seifert often took young out of games early if he felt that the 49ers had an insurmountable lead at the timeafter an easy 44–15 victory over the chicago bears in the divisional round the 49ers jumped out to a 31–14 halftime lead over the dallas cowboys in the nfc championship game holding on to win 38–28 young threw for two touchdowns while adding 47 yards and another touchdown on the ground as a result he went to his first super bowl as a starting quarterback the 49ers were heavy favorites to become the first team with five super bowl victorieson the strength of a sixtouchdown performance that surpassed the previous super bowl record of five owned by the man young replaced joe montana young was named the mvp of super bowl xxix as the 49ers defeated the san diego chargers 49–26 young also threw for 325 yards and rushed for 49 yards making him the first player ever to finish a super bowl as the games leader in both rushing and passing yardsthe victory capped off an incredible year for young who had one of the best seasons by a quarterback in nfl history he threw for 3969 yards a thenfranchise record 35 touchdown passes with only 10 interceptions completed 703 percent of his passes – the highest completion percentage of the 1990s third alltime and at the time the best completion percentage by any quarterback with more than 400 attempts later eclipsed by drew brees in 2009 additionally young broke joe montanas singleseason mark with a thenrecord 1128 passer rating and also once again demonstrated his great scrambling ability accumulating another 289 yards and seven touchdowns on the ground for his recordbreaking season performances young was awarded his second ap nfl mvp award becoming the seventh player in nfl history to win both league and super bowl mvp honors in the same seasonin the three years following super bowl xxix the 49ers were eliminated in the

1995 to 1997 young entered the 1998 season at age 37 and some began to wonder if his skills would diminish because of his history of injuries and a general decline in his game due to age however young silenced all critics once again putting up career numbers in passing yards 4170 and passing touchdowns 36 the 49ers finally beat favre and the packers in the nfc wild card round that year as young threw the winning touchdown to wide receiver terrell owens with three seconds remaining to win the game 30–27 in reference to dwight clarks legendary catch against the dallas cowboys in the 1981 nfc
