columbia records in 1973 smith signed a new recording contract with columbia records the label gave her more creative control including the opportunity to record one gospel album per year at columbia she met with clive davis who agreed to produce her however the label dismissed davis before they could work together instead producer billy sherrill chose to work with smith however a disagreement about religion ended the pairing before it began she started recording alongside producer george richey who recently had success writing material for george jones and tammy wynetteat columbia smith was pressured into recording with more pop production than before from day one at the new label even more than before it was a constant tussle because i just am who i am recalled smith however she remained active in song selection and the recording process smiths first columbia lp titled a lady named smith 1973 included pop production such as string instrumentation and overdubbed background vocals the lp reached number 31 on the billboard country albums chart richey agreed to release aint love a good thing as her first columbia single instead the richeysmith cowritten song youve got me right where you want me proved to be the first label single the decision disappointed smith enough that she chose to end their professional relationship the last richeyproduced project was smiths first columbia gospel lp titled god is abundant the album of religious material climbed to number 20 on the billboard country albums chartsmith chose ray baker to serve as her next producer baker had

smiths vocals following her columbia switch when reviewing the compilation connie smith sings her hits thom jurek of allmusic commented that she lost the grain in her voice jurek went on to write it could be said that regardless of the material she never made a bad record the tunes were carefully chosen its true but she never tried to hide the hardcore twang in her vocal style smiths biographer barry mazor found her voice to lower in range by this point and saw evidence of columbia attempting to push her recorded vocal into the upper end of her range other critics noticed stylistic changes but observed no change in her singing nprs ken tucker found her recordings in this era to feature more pop instrumentation but did not obscure the passion and pain she communicated so fearlesslyin 1975 columbia released both of her 1974 gospel projects the first was connie smith sings hank williams gospel for the album smith and baker went through the hank williams catalog where they came across a series of neverbeforereleased gospel songs the result was the first album of hank williams gospel material recorded by another artist in 1976 the project was nominated by the grammy awards

her twentieth top 10 a remake of the everly brotherss till i kissed you the latter was smiths second single to top canadas rpm country chartin 1977 smith moved to fred fosters nashville label monument records she was pressured into recording more country pop material than before and was given singing lessons by a songwriter he wanted to mold me into something that i wasnt comfortable with smith commented thats why that never worked allmusics stephen thomas erlewine found her monument music to have stateoftheart production that dates instantly walks the line between crossover pop and countrypop rather clumsly and lacks good material monument released two lps of smiths material between 1977 and 1978 her only commercially successful monument single was a cover of andy gibbs i just want to be your everything the single climbed to number 14 on the billboard country chart yet her other monument releases reached progressivelylower positions on the country chart between 1978 and 1979 furthermore smith had five children by this point and felt pressured to be at home with her family ultimately smith decided to leave her country music career entirely to focus on raising her children and tending to her religious needsfor three years smith remained in semiretirement committing only to occasional performances at the grand ole opry where she remained a member at the opry she only performed gospel songs however she decided to return to her career in 1983 she resigned with monument records but left after the label filed for bankruptcy instead singer and songwriter ricky skaggs helped her secure a new recording contract to epic records the first single a far cry from you 1985 was written by alternative country artist steve earle it reached number 71 on the hot country songs chartone day in the mid1990s smith was at her home talking to one of her daughters on the phone after telling her mother what she was going to do that night her daughter asked smith what her plans for that night were because she did not have anything fun planned smith lied so her daughter wouldnt have to worry about her after the conversation ended smith realized that she didnt need her own children worrying about her at the start of their adult lives and decided that it was time to return to her career with country artist marty stuart whom she later married in 1997 acting as the albums main producer smith signed a recording contract with warner bros records in 1996 although the label preferred her to record an album of duets smith decided to go by her own terms and record a solo studio album in october 1998 she released her second selftitled studio album it consisted of ten tracks nine of them cowritten by both smith and stuartsmiths 1998 project attracted limited commercial attention but was given critical praise for its traditional and contemporary style kurt wolff in the book country music the rough guide commented that the album sounded far gutsier than anything in the reba and garth mainstream thom jurek of allmusic gave the release four out of five stars calling it a solid effort and commenting it stands head and shoulders over most of the stuff thats come out of nash vegas in over a decade even if it doesnt sell a copy its a triumphant return for smith she hasnt lost a whit of her gift as a singer or as a writer also in 1998 smith made a second cameo appearance in a film portraying a singer at the rodeo dance in the hilo country starring woody harrelson and billy crudupin august 2003 she released a gospel album with country artists

still enjoyed making the record produced by country and bluegrass performer ricky skaggs whites husband the album received a nomination from the dove awards the website slipcuecom reviewed the release and stated that love never fails is probably too rowdy for most southern gospel fans who really like tinkly pianos and lesstwangy vocals and while it probably wont wow many country listeners for folks who are fans any of these three singers this is kind of a treatin november 2008 smith joined the cast of marty stuarts television series the marty stuart show which aired on the rfdtv network every saturday night the thirtyminute program featured traditional country music performed by both stuart and smith as well as radio personality eddie stubbs the show stopped airing on rfdtv in 2014 in

breakthrough years in the 1960s while most nashville sound recordings of the time mainly included full orchestras smiths sound remained more traditional with its use of steel guitar and her twangy vocals while still featuring some popinfluenced instrumentation to provide urban pop appeal critics have largely praised smiths use of the steel guitar which have often been described as sharp and prominent her steel guitar player weldon myrick is often credited with creating what smith has called the connie smith sound in an interview with colin escott in his book born to sing myrick recalls

female singer in the history of country music who can truly claim to be the heiress to patsy clines throne its not that there arent many amazing vocalists in the field and plenty of legends among them but in terms of the pure gift of interpretation of taking virtually any song and making it a country song of class and distinction smith is itwriters and journalists have also cited smith as an integral piece of country music history mary a bufwack and robert k oermann categorized her as one of countrys heroines of heartbreak due to her emotional vocal delivery bufwack and oermann further stated that along with tammy wynette smith was among the genres most towering country voices of the 1960s and 1970s who sang from the depths of despair and spoke for conservative middle america in
