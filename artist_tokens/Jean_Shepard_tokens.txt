acted in selfdefense dismissing him from being charged with crimesshepards vocals have been described by music writers as having a raw and assertive sound that paired well with honky tonk music author kurt wolff described her singing style as being hardcore and further wrote she had a firm voice one that could growl as well as yelp yodel and cry edd hurt of the nashville scene wrote shepard stayed in control but her voice gave body to songs that often explored the limits of what women could endure william grimes of the new york times said that she had a female country voice with muscle and ambition shepard also knew how to yodel often doing so during live performances and occasionally on recordings her yodeling was featured in the final section of her 1964 single second fiddle to an old guitar shepard later credited jimmie rogers records with teaching her how to yodelshepard was solely identified with the country genre throughout her career specifically with traditional country lyrically and musically her recordings were often categorized into the honky tonk subgenre which pointed to themes of infidelity alcohol romance and relationships ending critics referred to her capitol recordings for displaying honky tonk themes and found them to be the most memorable by female artists dan cooper of allmusic wrote she cut one great record after another mostly on capitol records nearly all of them crackle no matter the topic with honky tonk angel spirit mary a bufwack and robert k oermann stated in the final roll call of the great female honkytonk tunes are scores of jean shepard performancesmany of her 1950s and 1960s honkytonk recordings portrayed women in assertive roles that predated the 1960s feminist movement william grimes highlighted the songs the root of all evil is a man and many happy hangovers to you for planting the flag for independent women kurt wolff named dont fall in love with a married man and sad singin and slow ridin to be protofeminist and downright bold author peter la chapelle wrote that she not only sang pithy honky tonk numbers that bemoaned the behavior of the honkytonk man but even suggested that through collective action women could uproot the very foundations of the patriarchyshepards 1950s capitol recordings were also part of the bakersfield sound a country subgenre originating on the american west coast that had a rawer sound than its nashville counterpart and featured fender guitar instrumentation her 1950s california recording sessions featured session musicians like jimmy bryant roy harte fuzzy owen buck owens cliffie stone lewis talley and speedy west many of these musicians later had careers of their own and worked alongside other west country performers such as merle haggard writers and historians considered 1953s a dear john letter to be the first commerciallysuccessful recording to consist entirely of bakersfield musicianswhen the nashville sound musical style ushered in popinspired trends shepard mostly kept her traditional sound but at times experimented with softer pop elements in reviewing 1958s lonesome love allmusics richie unterberger found that the album combined good straightahead honky tonk with satisfying injections of pop chris skinker of the melody ranch girl box set noted that the nashville sound was starting to creep into jeans recordings by 1961 specifically pointing to the ethereal echoey sound of the guitar and the harmony vocals on specific songs as her career progressed shepards song choices explored more contemporary themes of loyalty and faithfulness other songs discussed sexuality such as 1974s poor sweet baby which describes a woman and a man about to have intercourse in 1975s another neon night shepards character is involved in a one night standmusic writers historians and journalists have noted that jean shepard was among country musics first commerciallysuccessful female artists with the exception of kitty wells and minnie pearl shepard was considered one of the female singers in the genre to reach similar success peter cooper of the country music hall of fame and museum wrote during the 1950s few women managed to break through industry barriers to enjoy fullblown country careers but jean shepard did just that ken burns of the pbs documentary country music wrote in the 1950s selfsupporting female country artists were rare women who rose to stardom on the west coast rather than through the grand ole opry were rarer still as were women who adopted a hardedged honkytonk style or sang from a woman ’ s perspective jean shepard was all that and more mary a bufwack and robert k oermann further explained that she was an exception due to her being a single woman jean shepards achievement is all the more remarkable because she was the only early1950s country music woman who made it on her ownshepards success in the 1950s was said to have influenced the careers of future female artists in the 1960s like loretta lynn tammy wynette and dolly parton other female country singers have since considered shepard an influence including elizabeth cook reba mcentire jeannie seely and connie smith yet shepard was considered by writers not to get the credit she deserved bobbie jean sawyer of the wide open country wrote jean shepard has never gotten her due recognition for opening doors for women in country music but its not too late to change that blake farmer of npr reported that many people believed her future membership into the country hall of fame was overdue in regards to her own legacy shepard believed for many years the country hall of fame ignored her early efforts in my case they were about 20 years overdue i just at some point decided theyd forgotten about me and i forgot about them she wrote in her autobiographyin 2010 shepard was inducted into the oklahoma music hall of fame her home state in 2011 shepard was inducted into the country music hall of fame along with songwriter bobby braddock and fellow oklahoma singer reba mcentirestudio albums†honorary former member was scheduled to be invited but died before the invitation was extended
