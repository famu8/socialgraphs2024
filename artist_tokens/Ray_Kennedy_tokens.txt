bachelordom i feel that i am better off without her he ended the season in good form though mee had already decided to move him on and replace him with brian kiddi couldnt believe it when he left and

become frustrated and disillusioned in the clubbob paisley felt kennedy could perform as a midfielder after kennedy replaced an injured peter cormack against middlesbrough on 1 november he went on to make the number five shirt his own for the rest of the decade his new position allowed him to use his vision and distribution to create chances for his teammates whilst still allowing him to make runs

the required standard saying he took five years off my career alan had no nerves and not much brain we didnt gel on the pitch alan blamed nerves for his difficulty in finding kennedy with accurate passes kennedy also began to face problems off the pitch resulting in both he and jimmy case being arrested after they attacked a hotelier who had confused kennedy with his namesake alan the pair pleaded guilty to affray and were fined £150 each despite this and other similar incidents kennedy did manage to avoid his offfield antics affecting his form or discipline on the pitch kennedy later

came eight days later in a 3–0 defeat to brazilian side flamengo in the 1981 intercontinental cup at tokyos national stadium he was replaced in the team by ronnie whelan liverpool went on to win the league title after finishing four points ahead of secondplace ipswich town and kennedys 15 league appearances in the first half of the campaign were enough to earn him another league championship medal sunderland attempted to sign him on loan in january 1982 but were denied by liverpool and kennedy could not agree on personal terms with manager alan durban so was not signed by sunderland on a permanent transferrays contribution to liverpools achievements was enormous and his consistency remarkable so much so in fact that on the rare occasions he missed a match his absence was felt deeply simply because he was a midfield power house with tremendous vision and knowledge of the game in my view he was one of liverpools greatest players and probably the most underratedin january 1982 kennedy was signed by swansea city on a fouryear contract for a £160000 fee to play under former teammate john toshack the swans had an unsuccessful attempt to win the league title and five defeats in their final six games saw them end up in sixth place 17 points behind champions liverpool they did though win the welsh cup after beating south wales derby rivals cardiff city 2–1 in the final at vetch field despite voicing his concerns over the team and his own future at the club to toshack kennedy was appointed club captain for the 1982–83 season he became injured with niggling hamstring problems in midseason and after one increasingly rare performance the local press described him as seemingly unwilling to work and his usual composure on the ball was lacking kennedys declining physical abilities were due to parkinsons disease however he would not be diagnosed with the condition until after his retirement toshack stripped kennedy of the captaincy and suspended him from vetch field for two weeks he was placed on the transfer list in march 1983 and swansea went on to be relegated into the second division the clubs financial problems worsened and players were asked to take a cut in wages to help ease the crisis but kennedy refused toshack was sacked in october 1983 and kennedy agreed to have his contract terminatedkennedy signed with mick dochertys hartlepool united of
