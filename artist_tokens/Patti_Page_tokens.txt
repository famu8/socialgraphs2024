oftenwhat every woman knows and theres a man in my lifethe first time i kissed you with the eddie getz and george barnes orchestras but they failed to chartshe found success with her third single confess bw twelve oclock flight the arrangement of confess was meant to use a backing chorus but mercury would not pay for one since page had not yet produced a charting single so if she wanted additional singers she would have to hire them at her own expense instead her manager jack rael decided to try an experiment bill putnam an engineer for mercury records was able to overdub pages voice
