millers music turn it on turn it up turn me loose was one of the first successful cuts for greekamerican songwriter kostas record producer tony brown had sent kostas demo of the song to pete anderson because he thought the song sounded like yoakam had written it because of this anderson suggested that yoakam begin writing songs with kostas the two cowrote both nothings changed here and send a

mellencamps composition common day man the two also joined joe ely john prine and james mcmurtry on the track sweet suzanne credited to buzzin cousins this song charted on hot country songs for five weeks in early 1992 it also accounted for yoakams second cma nomination in the category of vocal event of the year later in the year yoakam covered elvis presleys suspicious minds for the soundtrack

damour for the european market in 1992 this consisted mainly of selections from other albums as well as previously unreleased cover songsfor his next studio album 1993s this time yoakam wrote either

latter also became yoakams first entry on the billboard hot 100 peaking at 70 after these were try not to look so pretty and pocket of a clown which were less successful on the charts of the album anderson told gavin report that its really the first record weve made where we just took all the boundaries down while yoakam himself said that i felt that my musical statements on the preceding albums were valid but that they were complete statements and there was no need to further articulate them it was time to allow my music latitude he cited the track home for sale as an example describing it as a stone country lyric backed by a hammond organ an instrument not commonly used in country jurek noted influences of doowop in pocket of a clown and of roy orbison in aint that lonely yet in july 1994 yoakam began the this time tour a 75city tour which featured alison krauss and union station as an opening act the country music association nominated aint that lonely yet for single of the year in 1993 and yoakam himself in the category male vocalist of the year in 1994 the album achieved his highest riaa certification for tripleplatinum in 1996yoakam released two albums in 1995 the first was dwight live a live album recorded in july 1994 in san francisco stephen thomas erlewine wrote of this album that nothing on the album improves on the original recorded versions while tony scherman of entertainment weekly thought the album was beautifully paced and showed yoakams strengths as a vocalist the album was certified gold in 1996 his other release for 1995 was the studio album gone yoakam wrote the entire album collaborating with kostas on two songs among the backing vocalists were carl jackson jim lauderdale joy lynn white and the rembrandts nothing one of the collaborations with kostas was selected as the lead single and charted at number 20 on hot country songs in 1995 the songs bside gone thatll be me and sorry you asked were released as singles as well though neither reached top 40 jurek thought that individual tracks displayed influences of rhythm and blues mariachi tejano music and psychedelic rock jeffrey b remz of country standard time wrote that gone was a critically received album which did not do boffo numbers because yoakam received very little airplay for what was probably his most musically diverse album and in some parts of the country his tour did not draw crowds eitheryoakams next release for reprise was 1997s under the covers an album composed entirely of cover songs yoakam and anderson had begun recording songs for this project prior to gone while other selections previously appeared on la croix damour the project accounted for only one single in a rendition of the everly brothers claudette bluegrass musician ralph stanley played banjo on a cover of the clashs train in vain while sheryl crow sang duet vocals on a cover of sonny chers baby dont go jurek wrote of this album while this set is not perfect its still damn fine and warrants repeated listens to come to grips with yoakams visionary ambition remz praised the covers of glen campbells wichita lineman and train in vain in particular but criticized the cover of the beatles things we said today after this was an album of christmas music titled come on christmas released later in the year yoakam wrote the title track and santa cant stay while the rest of the album largely consisted of traditional christmas songs such as away in a manger and silver bells thom owens of allmusic wrote that the album contained highspirited entertaining countryrockers that may not add anything new to yoakams catalog but they make the record an enjoyable holiday albumbetween 1995 and 1997 yoakam received three consecutive grammy nominations in the category of best male country vocal performance the songs nominated in this category were pocket of a clown a thousand miles from nowhere and nothing he also received three consecutive nominations for best country album between 1996 and 1998 with the nominations going to dwight live gone and under the covers after these was his next studio album of original content 1998s a long way home yoakam wrote the entire project by himself making it his first not to have any cowriters or cover songs the album charted two singles in things change and these arms this album also featured ralph stanley this time as a duet partner on travelers lantern brian steinberg of country standard time thought that the album was back to basics and comparable to yoakams releases in the 1980s stating that this isnt yoakams most innovative work but it contains enough moments to make it worth attention also in 1998 yoakam funded a charity album for release on little dog records a label which his thenproducer and guitarist pete anderson owned this album was titled will sing for food and featured other artists recording renditions of yoakams songs among the artists contributing were sara evans mandy barnett kim richey gillian welch and david ball nash contrasted these two albums in a double review calling a long way home a fresh dynamic set updating his trademark bakersfielddoesla sound without sacrificing his honkytonk roots while stating that will sing for food had stunningly original interpretations steinberg gave the latter a mixed review praising the contributions of bonnie bramlett and scott joss while considering other cuts on the album too similar in sound to yoakams originalsin 1998 columbia records released a tribute to tradition a multiartist tribute album to 1960s and 1970s country music yoakam was one of several artists featured on the albums closing track same old train an original composition by marty stuart the track featured twelve other country musicians including earl scruggs merle haggard clint black and randy travis it charted for five weeks on hot country songs in late 1998 the song won grammy award for best country collaboration with vocals at the 41st annual grammy awards thus giving yoakam his second win from the organization it was also nominated for cma vocal event of the yearyoakam ended the decade with his second greatesthits package last chance for a thousand years dwight yoakams greatest hits from the 90s in addition to tracks from his 1990s reprise albums the compilation included three new songs these were covers of queens crazy little thing called love and waylon jennings ill go back to her and the new song thinking about leaving which yoakam wrote with rodney crowell the cover of crazy little thing called love served as the albums lead single peaking at 12 on the country charts and 64 on the hot 100 it was also his final number one on the canadian country music charts published by rpm before that publication closed in 2000 thinking about leaving was also issued as a single but did not enter the country music top 40 in 2000 crazy little thing called love was nominated for a grammy award for best male country vocal performanceyoakams tenure with reprise records ended with a pair of albums both released in 2000 the first was dwightyoakamacousticnet composed entirely of acoustic recordings with just yoakams vocal and acoustic guitar the only exception was a rerecording of guitars cadillacs which yoakam performed a cappella yoakam said that he was inspired to do such an album due to the success of similar acoustic renditions in his concerts he had originally planned to release the album through his website until representatives of reprise records thought the album had sales potential the album itself had minimalistic packaging as well consisting solely of a sticker with the albums name on the front of an otherwiseclear cd case steve huey of allmusic thought that the albums minimalism allowed a greater focus on yoakams vocal interpretation than previous albumshis other release in 2000 was tomorrows sounds today the album accounted for two charted singles in what do you know about love and a cover of cheap tricks i want you to want me yoakam cowrote with buck owens on three tracks the sad side of town alright im wrong and i was there the latter two of which were also recorded as duets with him although the two had previously sung together on streets of bakersfield owens rejected further collaborations throughout the 1990s as he considered yoakam too young but ultimately agreed to collaborate again when the two met at a concert in 1999 writing for allmusic hal horowitz thought the owens collaborations showed yoakams continued influence of the bakersfield sound of which owens was a part he also praised the guitar work of pete anderson and compared yoakams lyrical style to that of hank williams scherman was less favorable considering the material forgettable despite describing andersons guitar work with favor yoakam received his final cma nomination in 2001 when that institution nominated alright im wrong for vocal event of the year at the end of his contract with reprise parent company warner records issued a box set album titled reprise please baby the warner bros years the package consisted of 89 tracks from yoakams reprise catalog including previously unreleased songs and early demos also included was a duet with kelly willis on a cover of george jones and tammy wynettes golden ringyoakam spent much of 2001 and 2002 touring with brooks dunn he also founded a new record label called electrodisc after his contract with reprise expired the label partnered with audium records now mnrk music group for distribution his first audium release was 2003s population me this album charted two singles both of which were covers gregg henrys the back of your hand and mike stinsons the late great golden state also covered on this album was burt bacharachs trains and boats and planes timothy b schmit provided backing vocals on the late great golden state while willie nelson sang duet vocals on if teardrops were diamonds jurek found influences of jackson browne the eagles and chuck berry in the albums sound messinger wrote of the album that the complex innovative sound he and anderson have developed certainly merits repeated explorationbetween 2003 and 2004 yoakam released three more compilations of covers albums to fulfill contractual obligations with his labels the first was 2003s in others words on reprise this consisted entirely of cover songs mostly from movie soundtracks and tribute albums to which yoakam contributed the oldest track was a cover of the grateful deads truckin which yoakam cut in 1991 jurek wrote that the compilation was far from a stellar set but does fill in the gaps nicely rhino records released a greatesthits package titled the very best of dwight yoakam in 2004 this compilation was certified gold after its release erlewine thought that while the album did not contain many of his earlier songs it otherwise showed the range of his styles and would have potential appeal to fans who preferred his more rockinfluenced cuts such as the covers of crazy little thing called love and i want you to want me his third and final compilation was dwights used records on audium also in 2004 among the collaborators on this project were heather myles deana carter and the nitty gritty dirt band artists covered included john prines paradise zz tops im bad im nationwide and johnny cashs understand your man country standard time writer eli messinger thought that by drawing from a decades worth of material the album showed new variety in yoakams style over his traditional studio albumsin 2005 yoakam signed with new west records an americana music label based out of california his first release for the label was 2005s blame the vain it was also yoakams first credit as a producer as he had ended his relationship with pete anderson in 2004 at the time former rca records artist keith gattis had taken over as yoakams guitarist and bandleader yoakam said that he had contacted a number of producers until gattis encouraged him to produce by himself new west partnered with columbia records to release two singles to radio these were intentional heartache and the title track which both made the lower regions of the country charts in 2005 and accounted for yoakams last appearance there in the book dwight yoakam a thousand miles from nowhere don mcleese thought that andersons absence gave the album an unbridled lack of restraint citing the hard rock sound and spokenword coda of intentional heartache as examples ray waddell of billboard also noted a hardcharging sound to the album comparing various tracks to elvis presley rhino records reissued guitars cadillacs etc etc in 2006 to honor the albums 20th anniversary this reissue included previously unreleased demos and live tracks along with liner notes written by yoakamafter buck owens death in 2006 yoakam began performing covers of his songs in concert this culminated in his 2007 album dwight sings buck composed entirely of owens covers yoakam recorded the project with his touring band which at the time included thenformer mavericks member eddie perez on lead guitar yoakam stated that he and the band listened to owens originals to draw inspiration from the recordings among the songs chosen were act naturally crying time and close up the honky tonks the last of which served as the lead single a review in allmusic was favorable stating that he doesnt set out to imitate owens style or delivery but he does capture the essence of each song playing them as buck intended no frills no foolin aroundyoakam performed at the cma music festival in nashville tennessee in 2008 where he was joined by faith hill this was yoakams first appearance at the event in over 20 years he otherwise performed very few concerts in 2009 and 2010 citing the great recession and the rise of digital music distribution as a reason behind the slower pace of his career at the time despite this he still stated that he planned to continue releasing albums in july 2011 he resigned with warner for his next album 2012s 3 pears the album included production from rock musician beck on two tracks upon release it became his highest entry on the billboard 200 albums chart reaching number 18 mikael wood of the los angeles times thought the album displayed a softer side than yoakams previous efforts stephen thomas erlewine wrote of the album yoakam has surprised by digging deeper into every one of his obsessions creating a record that captures the careening adventurous spirit of the 60s without ever feeling doggedly retro its as fresh as any music hes ever made and one of his very best albumshis next warner album was 2015s second hand heart it reached the number two position on top country albums after its release his highest peak on that chart since buenas noches from a lonely room in 1988 it consisted almost entirely of original songs written by yoakam except a cover of the standard man of constant sorrow and anthony crawfords vs of birds erlewine found influences of the beatles buck owens and cowpunk in the albums arrangements ann powers of nprs first listen shared a similar opinion of the album also praising the brightness of its soundin 2016 yoakam was contacted by a label executive of sugar hill records who wanted him to record a bluegrass music album for them this album swimmin pools movie stars was released that same year it mostly comprises rerecordings of previous songs in his career including guitars cadillacs and please please baby yoakam coproduced with jon randall and

news of the musicians death on television prior to recording chuck dauphin of sounds like nashville thought the album brought out the bluegrass influences already present in such songs as what i dont know deming called the album a stylistic detour for dwight yoakam but its execution sums up many of his greatest strengths as an artist also in 2016 yoakam released covers of the monkees tomorrows gon na be another day and johnny rivers mountain of love on limited edition vinyl through third man records a label owned by jack whitealthough he has not released any albums since 2016 yoakam has

well as those in the genres of bakersfield sound cowpunk and country rockin 2022 he started the lsd tour with lucinda williams and steve earle he also performed a concert with old crow medicine show

financial failure leading to many of its crew members filing claims against yoakam in small claims court in addition yoakam fired pete anderson from his touring band in 2002 as a means of recouping the finances lost by this movie zac johnson of allmusic criticized the soundtrack for including snippets of film dialogue between tracks although he praised the individual songs and their inclusion of collaborators such as bekka bramlett mick jagger and billy gibbonsin 2002 yoakam had a role in the david fincher movie panic room before the movies release he told the associated press that he did not

three burials of melquiades estrada and wedding crashers in 2014 yoakam had a recurring role in season two of the cbs science fiction series under the dome he also reunited with thornton for season one of the amazon prime video original series goliathyoakams style is defined by a variety of influences both inside and outside country music these influences include rockabilly honkytonk neotraditional country bakersfield sound and country rock colin larkin wrote in the virgin encyclopedia of country music that yoakams music showed influences of the honkytonk country music of buck owens and lefty frizzell and a distinct antipathy toward the nashville popcountry scene stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic stated that with his strippeddown approach to traditional honky tonk and bakersfield country dwight yoakam helped return country music to its roots in the late 80s erlewine also noted that yoakams fanbase typically consisted of people who listened to roots rock and rock and roll thom jurek of allmusic thought that pete andersons electric guitar work was also an important part of his sound comparing such work to don rich of buck owens backing band the buckaroos jurek also thought that the prominent uses of electric guitar and hammond organ were examples of yoakams rock influencesyoakam describes his own songwriting style as fragmented he told al caudell of american songwriter that he usually wrote songs by coming up with a melody and then determining the intended mood from there he said he would come up with a thesis for the song he also stated that he preferred not to write in a linear fashion as he thought writing a song in one sitting would cause him to feel creatively burnt out he also said that memories of his childhood were influential in his songwriting style particularly in the bluegrass music to which he listened he told american songwriter that he enjoyed the irony thats always been part of bluegrass in that it sets melodic lilting melodies and upbeat tempos with the most tragic lyricscyndi hoelzle of gavin report noted yoakams appeal outside traditional country music stating in 1993 that is records sold across the boardto middleaged stonewall jackson fans and to young punk rockers whod seen dwight do his thing in la opening shows for los lobos and the violent femmes richard cromelin of the los angeles times noted that yoakams musical image was that of a brooding intensely private figure driven by restless ambition and an edgy intellectuality more commonly found in rock stars in the same article yoakam stated that i found out early that one of the ways i was able to make contact was through musical expression similarly he told gavin report in 1993 that my nature is to be absolutely dissectively analytic but with songwriting i have to leave it in a place thats not al caudell of american songwriter called yoakam a bluntly outspoken advocate of hardcore honkytonk music yoakam received negative attention from the nashville music scene early in his career due to his constant criticism of the genre among his criticisms were columbia records dropping johnny cash and mtv refusing to play country music videos of these criticisms he later stated that i learned a couple albums in that my opinions and observations on the industry were not pertinent to what i needed to do as an artist so i just really began to focus solely on what i was doing at the timeyoakams musical image is also defined by his typical outfits when onstage colin larkin of the virgin encyclopedia of country music wrote that like don
