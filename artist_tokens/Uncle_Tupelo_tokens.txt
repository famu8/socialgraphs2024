renowned for its impact on the alternative country music scene the groups first album no depression became a byword for the genre and was widely influential uncle tupelos sound was unlike popular country music of the time drawing inspiration from styles as diverse as the hardcore punk of the minutemen and the country instrumentation and harmony of the carter family and hank williams farrar and tweedys lyrics frequently referred to middle america and the working class of bellevillejay farrar along with his brothers wade and dade played in an early 1980s garage band named the plebes hailing from belleville illinois the plebes sought to enter a battleofthebands competition but needed another high school student as a member to perform they invited jeff tweedy a high school friend of jay farrar to join the band and play with them for the show despite a lack of skill with his instrument tweedy played an important role in the band by booking early gigs while the plebes had been playing music in a rockabilly style tweedy wanted to play punk rock like the music that he originally heard the group perform this caused tensions between tweedy and dade farrar who left the band two months after tweedy joinedbefore leaving the band in 1984 dade farrar introduced its members to mike heidorn the younger brother of his girlfriend heidorn then joined the group as their drummer the plebes then decided to change its name to the primitives a reference to a 1965 song by psychedelic rock group the groupies due to the unpopularity of punk rock in the st louis area the primitives began to play bluesoriented garage rock at fast tempos they performed regularly at a wedding hall in millstadt illinois where tweedys mother jo ann would collect the cover fee they also performed regularly at b st bar in belleville with bands such as the newsboys later sammy and the snowmonkeys charlie langrehr and the symptoms wade farrar was the lead singer of the band but his commitment to southern illinois university and an attempted enlistment in the united states army meant he was only able to dedicate a small amount of time to the group additionally heidorn broke his collarbone during a concert in 1986 which caused the band to go on hiatus jay farrar and tweedy continued to write songs and perform at heidorns house while he recovered and by 1987 they had restarted the group the primitives temporarily added tony mayr as a bassist so that tweedy could play guitar but a month later the band decided to keep tweedy on bass and remain a threepiece to avoid confusion with a successful british band also named the primitives they decided to change their name once again to uncle tupelo although they performed only 1960s cover songs as the primitives the trio decided to take a new approach and write their own music under their new namethe primitives renamed themselves uncle tupelo a name created by combining two randomly chosen words from the dictionary inspired by the name cartoonist chuck wagner a friend of the band created a character resembling an old fat elvis presley the trio recorded a foursong demo tape which got them supporting slots opening for headline artists such as johnny thunders and warren zevon tweedy met tony margherita while working as a clerk at euclid records in st louis after attending two of the bands shows margherita offered to become their manager uncle tupelo began to play regular shows at ciceros basement — a bar close to the campus of washington university in st louis bands playing in a similar style including brian hennemans group chicken truck often played at the venue which by late 1988 was considered the locus of a new music scene the band temporarily expanded to a fourpiece with the addition of the guitarist alex mutrux but soon reverted to a triouncle tupelo recorded demo tracks in the attic studio of future chicago punk producer matt allison in champaign illinois the demo distributed with the title not

slade soon afterward uncle tupelo recorded shaking hands soldiers joy on michelle shockeds album arkansas traveler and joined her on the accompanying tour with taj mahal and the band however the tour only lasted for a few shows because of managerial problems between shocked and the bandalternative rock had broken into the mainstream by 1992 and an album released in that style was expected to earn the group a majorlabel record deal however uncle tupelo did not want to follow in the footsteps of groups such as nirvana and decided to play country and folk songs as a big fuck you to the rock scene

offered his services for their next album over a span of five days buck produced the groups next album march 16–20 1992 buck allowed them to stay in his house during the sessions and charged no money for his services hennemans role was increased for this album and he taught himself how to play mandolin and bouzouki despite turning away from the style of popular alternative rock major labels began to show significant interest in uncle tupelo after march 16–20 1992 was released the album sold more than their two previous recordings combined although rockville was displeased that it did not conform to the style of popular alternative rockin 1992 joe mcewen of sire records began to pursue the band mcewen who brought notable acts such as dinosaur jr and shawn colvin to sire had been interested in them since hearing the not forever just for now demo tape at the urging of gary louris mcewen offered uncle tupelo a contract band manager tony margherita invoked the 50000 escape clause

europe but heidorn wanted to stay in belleville with his girlfriend whom he married in august 1992the band held auditions prior to the promotional tour for march 16–20 1992 and two candidates stood out bill belzer and ken coomer although farrar and tweedy agreed that coomer was the better drummer they were intimidated by his sixfootfour stature and long dreadlocks the band instead selected belzer as heidorns replacement but he only stayed with the band for six months tweedy explained belzers departurei want to believe it was purely musical and i honestly believe that it wasnt working musically i also believe that we werent emotionally mature enough to be close friends with a gay person at that point in our lives and bill was and is a very proud and righteous gay person very open about his homosexualityafter touring europe opening for sugar the band replaced belzer with coomer the band also experimented with new members john stirratt replaced brian henneman who left to form the bottle rockets while max johnston the brother of michelle shocked joined as a live mandolin and violin performer stirratt became the fulltime bassist allowing tweedy to perform more songs with the

track effigy to the aidsbenefit album no alternative produced by the red hot organizationwith the addition of stirratt coomer and johnston just prior to the recording of anodyne farrar and tweedys relationship became more tumultuous leading to verbal altercations after concerts in one account tweedy recalledaround this time i would say something into a microphone onstage and afterward pull me aside and say dont you ever fucking talk into that microphone again he would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my outofcontrol rampant ego more evidence of me feeling like i didnt have to be so fucking afraid anymoretweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band but farrar felt disdain for tweedys new carefree attitude years later farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing tweedy stroking the hair of farrars girlfriend an act which he believed to have been a proposition in january 1994 farrar called manager tony margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band farrar told margherita that he was no longer having fun and did not want to work with tweedy anymore soon after the breakup farrar explained his departure it just seemed like it reached a point where jeff and i really werent compatible it had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship probably after the first recordtweedy was enraged that he heard the news secondhand from margherita rather than directly from farrar the following day the two engaged in a verbal confrontation as a favor to margherita who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running farrar agreed to a final tour with uncle tupelo in north america tweedy and farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour due to farrars refusal to sing harmony on any of tweedys songs the band made its first appearance on national television during the tour when they were featured on late night with conan obrien sire had requested that the band perform the long cut on the show which further irked farrar since the song was written and sung by tweedyuncle tupelos last concerts two shows at the blue note in columbia missouri and two shows at mississippi nights in st louis took place from april 28 to may 1 1994 a special last leg poster was created for the occasion which facetiously promoted the band as st louiss 4th best country band based on a readers poll in the riverfront times on the last night tweedy and farrar each performed nine songs during the concert and mike heidorn performed as drummer during the encorefollowing uncle tupelos final tour tweedy encouraged his bandmates to join him in a new group while farrar searched for members for a band of his own tweedy was able to retain the rest of the uncle tupelo lineup and created wilco they began rehearsing a few days after the final uncle tupelo concert and by august 1994 they were in the recording studio for their first album am farrar asked jim boquist to join his new band son volt boquist was a multiinstrumentalist who had performed with joe henry as the opening act on uncle tupelos last tour boquist also recruited his brother dave and farrar convinced mike heidorn to leave belleville to join the group farrars new fourpiece began recording their debut album trace in november 1994wilco signed to reprise records while son volt signed with warner bros records son volt had an early college rock hit with drown from the album trace but wilco maintained a more commercially successful career in the years to follow regarding the possibility of a reunion mike heidorn reported in a popmatters interview that nothings ever for sure but i would have to say no such thing farrar said that he does not want the band to get back together while tweedy said that he believes that a reunion would not be productive musicallyfarrar and tweedy sued rockville records and dutch east india trading ceo barry tenenbaum in 2000 over royalties that the label allegedly owed them winning restitution from tenenbaum and the joint rights to uncle tupelos first three albums after securing the rights the band released a compilation entitled 8993 an anthology in 2003 uncle tupelo reissued their first three albums which before the lawsuit had cumulatively sold over 200000 copiesas the primitives tweedy and farrar were highly influenced by punk bands such as the ramones and the sex pistols however they began to listen to country music because punk rock was not well received in the belleville and st louis music scenes while they originally were introduced to country by their parents it was not until this time that they began to listen to it for leisure farrar typically wrote songs about middle america while tweedy wrote about more mainstream topics such as relationships farrar took influence from authors such as kurt vonnegut and jack kerouac whom he read while working at his mothers bookstore as a singer farrars lyrics would be frontandcenter during performances but the bands musical style was mostly driven by tweedy and heidorn jeff tweedy said in an interview with the st louis postdispatchwe probably have more influences than we know what to do with we have two main styles that have been influences for instance we like black flag as much as early bob dylan and dinosaur jr as much as hank williams to us hardcore punk is also folk music we draw a close parallel between the two well play both in the same set if we get a chance we dont have any biases as far as music is concernedtweedy in particular was inspired by the minutemen and wrote a song about d boon following boons death in a van accident the band has released songs originally performed by creedence clearwater revival the carter family lead belly gram parsons the soft boys the louvin brothers texas tornados and the stooges releasing march 16–20 1992 when alternative music was breaking through was a move inspired by neil youngs decision to release the challenging albums on the beach and tonights the night immediately after the commercially successful harvest critic michael corcoran likened the bands musical style to bob mould fronting soul asylum on a speededup version of a gram parsons songuncle tupelo is credited as one of the founders of the alternative country genre a blend of alternative rock and traditional country music while the genre eventually became associated with solo artists such as gram parsons and lyle lovett uncle tupelo is considered the first alternative country band some media outlets like the bbc have even suggested that they were the genres sole creator however tweedy and heidorn dispute this claim and farrar says that there is no difference between alternative country and other genres such as roots rock heidorn commented in a country standard time interviewits strange to hear uncle tupelo mentioned because what we were doing was in such a long line of musical history people are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball starting with woody guthrie and on to the early 60s and the flying burrito brothers that we were influenced by we didnt start a genre we contributed to a long line of fairly good music thats the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the songthe bands first three albums influenced contemporary roots rock artists such as richmond fontaine and whiskeytown uncle tupelos usage of distorted guitars to play a style of music that was known for its earnestness became a lasting trend in 1990s modern rock jason ankeny wrote in allmusic thatwith the release of their 1990 debut lp no depression the belleville il trio uncle tupelo launched more than simply their own career—by fusing the simplicity and honesty of country music with the bracing fury of punk they kickstarted a revolution which reverberated throughout the american undergroundtheir 1990 album no depression lent its name to an influential alternative country periodical due to the influence of the album and periodical the term no depression became a byword for alternative country—particularly for bands with punk rock influence the alternative country movement played an important role in the success of future traditionalist country acts such as robbie fulks and shelby lynnetimelinetake my wordweve been had
