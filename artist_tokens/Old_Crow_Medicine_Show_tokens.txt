carolina where they were embraced by the appalachian community their repertoire of oldtime songs grew as they played with local musiciansfuqua first brought home a bob dylan bootleg from a family trip to london containing a rough outtake called rock me mama passing it to secor not so much a song as a sketch secor would later say crudely recorded featuring most prominently a stomping boot the candycoated chorus and a mumbled verse that was hard to make out but the tune kept going through his mind a few months later while attending phillips exeter academy in new hampshire and feeling homesick for the south he added verses about hitchhiking his way home full of romantic notions put in his head by the beat poets and most of all dylansecor says he sang his amplification of the song all around the country from about 17 to 26 before i ever even thought oh i better look into this when he sought copyright in 2003 to release the song on ocms in 2004 he discovered dylan credited the phrase rock me mama to bluesman arthur big boy crudup who likely got it from a big bill broonzy recording in a way its taken something like 85 years to get completed secor says secor and dylan signed a cowriting agreement and share copyright on the song agreeing to a 50–50 split in authorshipofficially released twice on an early ep and their second album ocms in 2004 the song would become the

while you almost got me crying doc invited the band to participate in his annual merlefest music festival in wilkesboro north carolina for 2000 2000 that gig changed our lives and we look to it as a pivotal turning point as old crow medicine show says secor he and fuqua wrote a song about being on the corner in boone and discovering us it honors doc and the high country blues soundthe big busking break led to the acts relocation to nashville in october 2000 at merlefest secor explains sally williams from the grand ole opry invited us to participate in some summer music events at the grand ole

described as a folkbluegrassaltcountry blendwe just knew we wanted to combine the technical side of the old sound with the energy of a nirvana states fuqua starting from oldtime music in the appalachian hills the group found themselves making a foray into electric instruments and really knocking up the rock n roll tree on their 2008 release tennessee pusher on the documentary big easy express about the railroad revival tour with mumford sons and edward sharpe and the magnetic zeros they practiced a complimentary variation of folk bringing a pleasingly smoky amalgam of country bluegrass and blues with carry me back 2012 theyve circled back to the original sound that so excited secor and fuqua as kids full of oldtimey string sounds updated for the 21st century—singalongs that lift the soul ballads that rend the heart and a few moments of pure exhilarationour performance comes out of all those years spent cutting our teeth on the street corner claims secor the earliest beginnings of the group involved busking in the northeast us attracting fresh talent guitjo player kevin hayes—originally from haverhill massachusetts—was in bar harbor maine raking blueberries when he encountered secor on the street in front of a jewelry store playing the banjo 5 bassist morgan jahnig joined the group as a result of a random encounter with early old crow performing on the streets of nashville in 2000 guitarist gill landry first met the group in 2000 while both were street performing during mardi gras in new orleans joining fulltime in 2007an early secor influence was john hartford who performed for his first grade class in missouri making him want to play the banjo after that and the first song he ever learned to play was tom paxtons ramblin boy 6 guns n roses was fuquas first influence when they released appetite for destruction 1987 while he was in seventh grade he knew he wanted to be a musician he also claims acdc and nirvana as influences and then into blues and then into more obscure fiddlers some conjunto from down in san antonio take em away written when he was 17 is loosely based on mance lipscomb a blues singer and sharecropper from navasota county who he says was a big influence on menaming his major influences secor states certainly bob dylan bob dylan bob dylan more than anything else more than any book or song or story or play the work and the recorded work of bob dylan its the most profound influence on me and then the other people that really influenced me tend to be the same people who influenced bob dylan fuqua concurs on dylans influencehes a link to woody guthrie whos a link to an even earlier form of american music history hes a great doorway for all sorts of artists because hes not just folk or just rock i think bands like us mumford and sons and gillian welch and david rawlings are sort of doing what he has done before in that we take our own experiences and observations and put them into songs made of traditional american roots form that form is still a great vehicle for songs whether the song is about love the iraq war or anything elsethe dylan doorway led to the first recordings of the new lost city ramblers the jim kweskin jug band canned heat the lovin spoonful dylan and the band in the basement and the grateful deadwhile it would be going a bit far to say old crow sparked a fullblown folk revival these guys have contributed mightily to a major shift in youthful attitudes toward ownership authenticity and what it means to feel included in a musical experience lyrics dont have to be strict autobiography to connect songs dont have to be entirely original to showcase originality and younger generations need not turn up their noses at music that doesnt treat them like theyre at the center of the universe—jewly hight american songwriterwhen secor fuqua and company first got together oldtimey pickers their age were few and far between modern rock was still a force to be reckoned with now harddriving string bands are where its at to americana music association ama president jed hilly the historic path of americana music passes through the group the baton is passed from emmylou harris to gillian welch and david rawlings to old crow medicine show to the avett brothers emmylou harris was in fact among the gateway artists who helped mumford and bandmates ben lovett ted dwane and winston marshall discover their love for american roots music it started with the o brother where art thou soundtrack that eventually led them to the old crow medicine show and then deep immersion in oldtimey sounds from americas longneglected pastyou cant swing a cat these days without hitting a hipster with a banjo in his hands at least part of the credit for this phenomenon goes to old crow medicine show—chrissie dickinson chicago tribunemarcus mumford front man of mumford sons credits the groups influence i first heard old crows music when i was like 16 17 and that really got me into like folk music bluegrass i mean id listened to a lot of dylan but i hadnt really ventured into the country world so much so old crow was the band that made me fall in love with country music mumford acknowledges in big easy express emmett malloys moving documentary about the vintage train tour theyd invited old crow to join them on that the band inspired them to pick up the banjo and start their now famous country nights in londonold crow received the 2013 trailblazer award from the americana music associationit takes a lot to figure out how to keep one foot in oldtime and one foot in all time its a bit of a dance to be rooted and modern at the same time i think weve figured out how to write those songs that sound like they were sung by some campfire 85 years ago but sound good blasted from the stereo of a ford ranchero in a burger king parking lot somewhere outside of enid—ketch secorearly on the group didnt perform songs theyd written instead drawing on a storehouse of prewar jug band string band minstrel show blues and folk fare as with other young groups in the genre driven by all that punk music energy they played this old material fast and hard when they started writing original material they distinguished themselves from the crowded field of new wave string bands as genuine stars and both groups have done it by writing new songs more ambitious than mere rewrites of old hillbilly and blues numbers songs they write often have a socially conscious theme such as i hear them all ways of man aint it enough and levisecor admits to developing the habit of writing what he calls stolen melody songs—in much the same way hed created wagon wheel carrying on in the folk tradition—like when he penned fresh war taxthemed lyrics to a tune that had already passed through other wholesale rewrites during its descent from oldtime scotsirish balladry dave rawlings states ive always thought that a really important thing that the old crow medicine show brought to the table was new songs—some reinterpreted old ones some really nicely written and brand new—with the old flavor but also with that vitalitythe lineup has changed and we arent the same group of guys that set out for the indian reservation in south dakota in 1998 were not the same group of individuals that picked grapes in new york state to fill our gas tank and roll out of townin august 2011 the group announced they were on hiatus cancelling three shows scheduled for the following month with little word from the band on whether there would continue to be a band original member willie watson left in fall of 2011 a couple months before chris critter fuqua rejoined the group in january 2012 he had left in 2004 to go to rehab for his drinking then staying out to attend college cory younts who left old crow a few months into 2012 to perform in jack whites backup band los buzzardos or the buzzards on world tour to support whites album blunderbuss returned to the group in 2013announced may 13 2024 cofounder fuqua was back with the group sayingmy relationship with the band is a bit like a saturn 5 rocket for whatever reason i need to leave sometimes i achieve an escape vector from the gravitational pull of old crow then i ’ m off into space orbiting floating in zero gravity in my capsule but i always seem to come around again shooting through the atmosphere my pod landing in the ocean the boys picked me up again i ’ m so glad they did i really missed themcurrent members of the bandformer members†honorary former member was scheduled to be invited but died before the invitation
