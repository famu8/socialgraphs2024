just beginning right now in 2002 because in spite of all the great things that have happened for the band feel musically its just really beginning although she alternates between solo releases and works with the band she has said there is no difference in her involvement between the twoas a group akus have been called american favourites worldbeaters and the tightest band around while they have been successful as a group many reviews note krauss still remains the undisputed star and rocksolid foundation and have described her as the bands focus with an angelic voice that flows like honey her

rice many of her songs are described as sad and are often about love especially lost love though krauss has a close involvement with her group and a long career in music she rarely performs music she has written herself she has also described her general approach to constructing an album as starting with a single song and selecting other tracks based on the first to give the final album a somewhat consistent theme and mood she most commonly performs in the bluegrass and country genres though she has had two songs on the adult contemporary charts has worked with rock artists such as phish and sting and is sometimes said to stray into pop musickrauss did not think she would make music videos at the beginning of her career after recording her first she was convinced it was so bad that she would never do another nonetheless she has continued to make further videos many of the first videos she saw were by bluegrass artists dan tyminski has noted that the video for thriller was very popular at the time she was first exposed to music videos she has made suggestions on the style or theme to some videos though she tends to leave such decisions to the director of the particular video the group chooses directors by seeking out people who have previously directed videos that band members have enjoyed the director for a video to if i didnt know any better from lonely runs both ways for example was selected because krauss enjoyed work he had done with def leppard and she wondered what he could do with their music while style decisions are generally left to the various directors of the videos many – including for the lucky one restless goodbye is all we have new favorite and if i didnt know any better – follow a pattern in all of these videos krauss walks sometimes interacting with other people while the rest of the band follows herkrauss has said she used to dislike working in the studio where she had to perform the same song repeatedly but has come to like studio work roughly the same as live stage performances her own favorite concert experiences include watching three foreigner concerts during a single tour a dolly parton concert and a larry sparks
