pleased to have recorded a duet with jones whom he considered a musical idol he also noted that bubba shot the jukebox written by dennis linde had been serviced as a joke by nashville song promoters and was not taken seriously by other artists but he felt that the song had potential the song was not originally intended to be a single but was selected as one after a number of stations on the billboard survey played the song frequently enough for it to enter the charts mansfield wrote in allmusic that the album heralded the emergence of a texas voice that contained both the knack for humor and the depth for heartache nash praised the song variety highlighting the singles and its not over in particular but felt that chesnutts voice was a little too laid backchestnutts third album for mca was almost goodbye released in 1993 it produced three straight numberone singles on hot country singles tracks it sure is monday also written by linde the title track and i just wanted you to know the albums final single a cover of don gibsons 1972 single woman sensuous woman was less successful on the charts the album also became his third to be certified platinum mansfield wrote of the album in allmusic that weak material weighs down chesnutts third release though he still sings them like the most romantic western swinger since george strait he praised the title track for its string section but criticized the uptempo material as being inferior to bubba shot the jukebox and old flames have new names nash felt that the album was classa honkytonk ballad and texas swing delivered by a guy whose instincts are usually as sure as his pitch but criticized the lyrics of the closing track the will also in 1993 chesnutt won two awards from the country music association the horizon award and vocal event of the year for george jones 1992 single i dont need your rockin chair which featured chesnutt as one of several guest vocalists and was awarded to all participants on the song following the success of almost goodbye chesnutt embarked on his first headlining tours in 1994 a move which chesnutt later said inspired him to focus more on songwriting due to the minimal profitability from touringin 1994 mca revived the nashville branch of decca records and moved chesnutt to it his first decca album what a way to live came out that year the album included four singles she dreams goin through the big d gon na get a life and down in tennessee of these she dreams was previously a single in 1993 for its cowriter tim mensy while down in tennessee was previously a single for john anderson in 1985 gon na get a life was the most successful of the singles reaching the top of the billboard country charts in 1995 two other cover songs were included on the album as well the title track was originally recorded by willie nelson in 1960 while a cover of waylon jennings 1974 single rainy day woman included jennings on duet vocals and lead guitar chesnutt said that he chose to record the jennings cover at the suggestion of his managers while listening to jennings albums on his tour bus and that wright was responsible for making arrangements for jennings to appear on the song the album received a positive review from david zimmerman of gannett news service who praised the variety of traditionalleaning country sounds and chesnutts singing voice stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic was less favorable stating that the album is dogged by inconsistent material but chesnutts fine singing manages to save most of the weaker material from being a bore what a way to live earned a gold certification from the riaa in 1995 for shipments of 500000 copieshis next album wings came out in 1995 for this album tony brown served as producer instead of wright according to chesnutt he chose a different producer because wright had wanted to push him to a more country pop style a change with which chesnutt disagreed chesnutt noted that the album was completed more quickly than his previous ones while the others took an average of two months to complete due to him having to schedule recording sessions around tour dates he was able to complete wings in only ten consecutive days he also took most of april and may 1995 off from touring and resumed in june on a tour that also featured brooks dunn contributing songwriters on wings included jim lauderdale and mack vickery the first single was a cover of todd sniders trouble which chesnutt took to top 20 of hot country songs in 1995 the albums second single it wouldnt hurt to have wings was a topten country hit while followup wrong place wrong time was less successful on the charts also included on the album was a cover of hank williams jrs 1972 hit prides not hard to swallow chesnutt cowrote the track as the honky tonk turns which he said was inspired by his early days singing in honkytonk bars and observing the crowds rick mitchell in the encyclopedia of country music described it as a honkytonk concept album that bucked the commercial trend toward throwaway novelty tunes and lightweight countrypop the album received largely positive reviews from publications such as country standard time billboard and allmusic all of which praised the songwriting quality and honkytonk stylings of the music with the former two publications also considering it among the strongest album releases of the yeardecca issued a greatest hits package in 1996 this album reprised ten of his biggest hits and included two new songs in its a little too late and let it rain both were released as singles with the former becoming a numberone single on billboard in 1997 at the time of this compilations release chesnutt stated that he had toured almost nonstop for the past six years and that he had wanted to take longer breaks between touring but was unable to since his album sales were not as strong as those of his contemporaries four years after its release greatest hits became chesnutts fourth and final platinum albumin 1997 chesnutt released thank god for believers which reunited him with wright on production duties of their reunion wright said that he felt that both of them were on a downslide prior to wings while chesnutt said that mark and i kind of got away from each other for awhile because we needed it we both lost a little bit of what we started together and that once the two started working together it was like we were never apart the album also featured several songs penned by roger springer with whom chesnutt soon developed a friendship and songwriting relationship this albums title track which also served as the lead single ascended to the number two position on the hot country singles tracks charts by the end of 1997 while finishing the album chesnutt and wright chose to include the same recording of its not over that had previously appeared on longnecks short stories to replace a song that the two felt did not fit with the rest of the album its not over was sent out as the second single from thank god for believers due to demand from radio listeners chesnutt agreed to release the song because he felt it had potential as a single and he was disappointed that it had not been a single from its original album two more singles followed in 1998 i might even quit lovin you and wherever you are nash called the album a sometimes stunning reminder of the singer ’ s firstrate smoothasbourbon interpretive style thom owens wrote in allmusic that the album was strong thoroughly enjoyable modern countryin late 1998 chesnutt recorded a cover version of aerosmiths i dont want to miss a thing at the suggestion of wright who had heard the song on his car radio because the two thought that the song had potential as a single decca withdrew promotion of wherever you are in favor of the cover which resulted in wherever you are becoming his first single not to make top 40 on the country music charts chesnutt said that he decided to cover the song because he felt that despite his chart successes he wasnt getting noticed due to the weaker sales of his last two albums compared to his first three he felt that covering a pop song would show people could sing something other than the same old stuff while also noting that many of his previous successful songs had been ballads by early 1999 his version of i dont want to miss a thing had reached the top of the hot country singles tracks charts it was also his first entry on the billboard hot 100 where it ascended to no 17 despite showing favor toward the cover song at the time he later expressed disdain for recording it he told the blog taste of country in 2018 that he did not think that it fit his established style that neither the single nor the corresponding album sold well despite the songs success at radio and that he had refused offers from the label to release another cover of a pop song the corresponding album also titled i dont want to miss a thing went on to account for only one other single in this heartache never sleeps which reached top 20 on the country music charts nash wrote of the album that the cover was a bit of a jolt but added that chesnutt goes on to find enough snappy rhythm tunes and scampering western swing to keep the toes tapping an uncredited review from people magazine praised chesnutts singing voice and the good and varied songsin january 1999 mca nashville dissolved the decca nashville division while most of the artists were dropped chesnutt was one of only three to move back to mca alongside lee ann womack and gary allan mca released his album lost in the feeling in october 2000 the album included covers of two songs cowritten and originally recorded by shawn camp on his 1993 selftitled debut album which was also produced by wright fallin never felt so good and confessin my love also covered on the album were the title track previously a single for conway twitty in 1983 and gene watsons 1975 single love in the hot afternoon fallin never felt so good and lost in the feeling were both issued as singles but neither made top 40 of the country music charts a review in billboard was positive stating that seldom has he packed more authority and emotion into a recording highlighting the cover songs in particular maria konicki dinoia of allmusic also showed favor toward the cover songs while comparing chesnutts voice to that of merle haggard lost in the feeling was commercially unsuccessful and chesnutt was dropped from mcas roster one month after the albums release despite not being on a label at the time he sang duet vocals on tracy byrds early2001 single a good way to get on my bad side from byrds album ten roundschesnutt signed to columbia records in 2002 for the release of his selftitled studio album the lead single she was went to number 11 on hot country singles tracks and number 62 on the hot 100 while the followup singles i want my baby back and im in love with a married woman did not reach top 40 of the former to promote the album chesnutt went on a 75date tour known as the rockin roadhouse tour which also featured joe diffie and tracy lawrence billy joe walker jr produced the album and contributing musicians included aubrey haynie brent mason and dan dugmore both william ruhlmann of allmusic and peter cooper of the tennessean criticized the album for weak songwriting while john lupton of country standard time felt that the album was about average for him butits an average thats usually a cut above chesnutt later stated that he quickly left columbia records because executives had pressured him into recording more modernsounding country pop instead of his traditional style a concern that he had also had during his latter years at mcachesnutts eleventh album savin the honky tonk was released in 2004 via the independent vivaton label jimmy ritchey was the albums producer and one of several contributing songwriters along with chesnutt jerry salley dean miller jason sellers and kevin fowler chesnutt said that he intended for the album to be a return to the honkytonk sounds of his earlier albums and felt that being on an independent label allowed for him to record music that he wanted to record as opposed to being pressured into recording songs that were forced upon him by majorlabel executives the album accounted for three singles the lord loves the drinkin man im a saint and a hard secret to keep erlewine said of the album that chesnutt not only sounds comfortable and relaxed hes reenergized both by the straightahead setting and the freedom to pick songs without an eye on the airwaves robert loy of country standard time considered the disc a concept album noting the unifying theme of alcohol consumption in most of the songs chesnutt toured small venues in 2004 and 2005 in support of the albumheard it in a love song followed in 2006 on cbuj records its title track was previously a pop hit for the marshall tucker band and many of the other songs on the album were covers as well including charley prides a shoulder to cry on and hank williamss lost highway barry gilbert of the st louis postdispatch rated the album b praising chesnutts singing voice and the contrast of the title track with the other cover songs mark deming of allmusic stated that while heard it in a love song lacks the hard country feel of its a solid set that confirms the mans musical instincts are back on trackchesnutt signed to lofton creek records in 2007 his only disc for the label was rollin with the flow the title track of which was a numberone single on the country charts for charlie rich in 1977 chesnutts version reached number 25 on the same chart in late 2007early 2008 and she never got me over you made the charts as well the album once again featured jimmy ritchey as producer with contributing musicians including glenn worf brent mason eddie bayers and lonnie wilson ritchey also cowrote several songs on the album mark deming of allmusic wrote of the album that it was as solid an album as chesnutts ever recorded — which is saying plenty writing for roughstock matt bjorke said that it was the kind of record that traditionalist country fans dream about it has something for all those fans highlighting chesnutts vocal delivery on the title track in particularin 2010 chesnutt announced the release of his next studio album outlaw the album includes covers of songs by outlaw country artists including waylon jennings willie nelson hank williams jr kris kristofferson billy joe shaver david allan coe and jerry jeff walker according to chesnutt he was presented the idea by record producer pete anderson best known for his work with dwight yoakam when saguaro road records was seeking an artist to perform a covers album the two recorded the album at andersons studio in burbank california in only two days to support the album he toured with tracy lawrence and richie mcdonald of lonestar on the country rat pack tour thom jurek referred to the album as a nofrills solid lean mean rocking emotionally sincere tribute to the outlaw generation which is in many ways an extension of chesnutts own personachesnutt formed his own label nada dinero in 2012 his first release through this label was a live album called live from the big d recorded in dallas texas this was followed by a second greatest hits package in 2015 the album accounted for one single when the lights go out tracies songchesnutt continued to tour throughout the 2010s in 2013 george jones invited chesnutt to be his opener on the last show of his farewell tour at bridgestone arena in nashville tennessee however jones died before the show could take place so chesnutt and other artists held a tribute show in joness honor instead his next studio album tradition lives came out in 2016 included on the album was a cover of merle haggards there wont be another now from his 1985 album kern river according to chesnutt the cover was something that ritchey and chesnutt had done for fun without the intention of ever putting it on an album due to it being one of chesnutts favorite merle haggard songs as haggard died just before the albums release they chose to include it as a tribute to him of the albums sound chesnutt remarked that i wanted to show the world that i ’ m still here and that i ’ m still country i ’ m not changing with the times erlewine noted the simple spare and easy production of the album and thought that it was similar in sound to chesnutts earlier albumsin 1993 chesnutt was featured in an ad campaign for fritolay where he sang their tagline i know what i like and i like fritos in 1994 he contributed three cover songs to multiartist compilation albums these were merle haggards goodbye comes hard for me recorded for the aids benefit album red hot country keith whitleys i never go around mirrors ive got a heartache to hide to keith whitley a tribute album and good ones and bad ones a duet with george jones on the latters 1994 duets album the bradley barn sessions in 1996 the radio station wkis in boca raton florida compiled a christmas album titled a country christmas from wkis 999 to which chesnutt contributed a recording of the christmas carol what child is this his version made the hot country songs charts that same year due to seasonal airplaychesnutts musical style draws mainly from honkytonk and neotraditional country due to both singers hailing from beaumont chesnutt was frequently compared stylistically to george jones jack hurst of the chicago tribune wrote that he was a throwback to the inwardlytough justdoit kind of country star they were making back when they minted george jones who preceded chesnutt out of the roughandtumble east texas honkytonks 40 years ago nash described chesnutts vocal style by saying that he has a comely smooth baritone and a supple way of moving through his vocal range and a friendly foghorn with earnestness rick mitchell writing in the encyclopedia of country music described chesnutt as arguably the strongest purecountry voice to come out of southeastern texas since george jones and an uncredited review in people said that chesnutt has a natural george jonesian sob and enough machismo to get away with going falsetto when he wants chesnutt has cited merle haggard hank williams and elvis presley as major influences of his mitchell also noted that chesnutt was able to have success with both ballads and uptempo material such as bubba shot the jukebox and old flames have new names as well as the strong presence of cover songs from the 1950s and 1960s some of his songs such as it sure is monday and gon na get a life have featured influences of cajun music through prominent use of fiddle and accordionchesnutts musical persona placed a greater emphasis on song quality over physical attractiveness compared to the move toward young and attractive males that prevailed in country music in the 1990s nash stated that he distanced himself from the pack with an identifiable baritone and a focus on music over image and barry gilbert of the st louis postdispatch similarly stated that he put the music and his warm classiccountry voice before the image chesnutt stated in a 1996 interview that i would rather play honkytonks the rest of my life for 500 a week than be something im not he noted that during his latter years at decca and mca he was constantly pressured by label heads to record more mainstreamfriendly country pop instead of the traditional sounds of his earlier albums due to the genres shift away from neotraditional country having a negative impact on his album sales he also said that some of the tracks on savin the honky tonk were songs that the major labels had rejected and that he would rather sell 100000 albums than 6 million of some crap that i wasnt happy withchesnutt has been married to the former tracie motley since 1992 the two met in a bar and according to chesnutt she came out there with a guy she was with at the time and i took her away from him the couple have three sons waylon casey and cameron waylon was named after waylon jennings who jokingly suggested during the recording sessions for their cover of rainy day woman that the thenpregnant tracie name their child after him although jennings later stated that the suggestion was a joke chesnutt decided to choose the name anyway in late 1995 following waylon chesnutts birth tracie typically stayed home at the couples house in jasper texas while also working as an artist the birth of his sons also caused chesnutt to tour less frequently by the end of the 1990s as he wanted to be able to spend more time with his familyin october 2021 chesnutt announced that he would be taking a hiatus from touring until 2022 in order to recover from back surgery on november 1 2023 chesnutt was hospitalized for an issue that required critical care and underwent multiple tests to determine the exact problem several of his
