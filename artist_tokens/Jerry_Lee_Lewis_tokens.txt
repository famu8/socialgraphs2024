matchbox your true love and put your cat clothes on and billy lee rileys flyin saucers rocknrollon december 4 1956 elvis presley dropped in on phillips to pay a social visit while perkins was in the

maybelle cover and great balls of fire his biggest hit bringing him international fame and criticism of the songs which prompted some radio stations to boycott them in 2005 whole lotta shakin goin on was selected for permanent preservation in the national recording registry of the library of congress according to several firsthand sources including johnny cash lewis a devout christian was troubled by the sinful nature of his own material which he believed was leading him and his audience to hell this aspect of lewiss character was depicted in waylon paynes portrayal of lewis in the 2005 film walk the line based on cashs autobiographiesas part of his stage act lewis pounded the keys with his heel kicked the piano bench aside and played standing raking his hands up and down the keys sat on the keyboard and stood on the piano he told the pop chronicles that kicking over the bench originally happened by accident but when it got a favorable response he kept it in the act his inaugural television appearance in which he demonstrated some of these moves was on the steve allen show on july 28 1957 where he played whole lotta shakin goin onhis dynamic performance style can be seen in films such as high school confidential he sang the title song from the back of a flatbed truck and jamboree cub koda called him rock rolls first great wild man and also rock rolls first great eclectic classical composer michael nyman has also cited lewiss style as the progenitor of his own aestheticin 1960 phillips opened a new stateoftheart studio at 639 madison avenue in memphis abandoning the old union avenue studio where phillips had recorded bb king howlin wolf elvis presley roy orbison carl perkins lewis johnny cash and others and also opened a studio in nashville it was at the latter studio that lewis recorded his only major hit during this period a rendition of ray charless whatd i say in 1961 in europe other updated versions of sweet little sixteen september 1962 uk and good golly miss molly march 1963 entered the hit parade on popular eps hang up my rock and roll shoes ive been twistin money and hello josephine also became turntable hits especially in nascent discothèques another recording of lewis playing an instrumental boogie arrangement of the glenn miller orchestras in the mood was issued on the phillips international label under the pseudonym the hawklewiss turbulent personal life was hidden from the public until a may 1958 british tour where ray berry a news agency reporter at londons heathrow airport the only journalist present learned about lewiss third wife myra gale brown she is lewiss first cousin once removed and was 13 years old when they married—though lewis who was 22 years old at the time claimed she was actually 15 the publicity caused an uproar and the tour was canceled after only three concertslewiss sun recording contract ended in 1963 and he joined smash records where he made several rock recordings that did not further his career the team at smash a division of mercury records came up with im on fire a song that they felt would be perfect for lewis and as colin escott writes in the sleeve to the retrospective a half century of hits mercury held the presses thinking they had found lewiss comeback hit and it might have happened if the beatles hadnt arrived in america changing radio playlists almost overnight mercury didnt really know what to do with lewis after that one of smashs first decisions was to record a retread of his sun hits golden hits of jerry lee lewis which was inspired by the continuing enthusiasm european fans had shown for lewiss firebrand rock and roll in june 1963 lewis returned to the uk for the first time since the scandal that nearly ended his career five years earlier to headline a performance on the mv royal daffodil for a crosschannel rock and roll cruise from southend essex to boulogne france for this performance he was backed by ritchie blackmore and the outlaws none of lewiss early smash albums including the return of rock memphis beat and soul my way were commercial successesone major success during these lost years was the concert album live at the star club hamburg recorded with the nashville teens in 1964 which is considered one of the greatest live albums ever in joe bonomos book lost and found producer siggi loch stated that the recording setup was uncomplicated with microphones placed as close to the instruments as possible and a stereo mic placed in the audience to capture the ambience the results were sonically astonishing with bonomo observing detractors complain of the albums crashing noisiness the lack of subtlety with which jerry lee revisits the songs the fact that the piano is mixed too loudly but what is certain is that siggi loch on this spring evening captured something brutally honest about the killer about the primal and timeless centre of the very best rock roll the album showcases lewiss skills as a pianist and singer honed by relentless touring in a 5outof5stars review milo miles wrote in rolling stone magazine that live at the star club hamburg is not an album its a crime scene jerry lee lewis slaughters his rivals in a thirteensong set that feels like one long convulsionfrustrated by smashs inability to score a hit lewis was planning on leaving the label when promotions manager eddie kilroy pitched the idea of cutting a pure country record in nashville with nothing to lose lewis agreed to record the jerry chesnut song another place another time which was released as a single on march 9 1968 and to everyones amazement shot up the country charts at the time of the release lewis had been playing iago in a rock and roll adaptation of othello called catch my soul in los angeles but was soon rushed back to nashville to record another batch of songs with producer jerry kennedy what followed was a string of hits that no one could have predicted although country music always remained a major part of lewiss repertoire as colin escott observes in the sleeve to the 1995 compilation killer country the conversion to country music in 1968 looked at the time like a radical shift but it was neither as abrupt nor as unexpected as it seemed jerry had always recorded country music and his country breakthrough another place another time had been preceded by countless country records starting with his first crazy arms in 1956 the last time lewis had had a song on the country charts was with pen and paper in 1964 which had reached number 36 but another place another time would go all the way to number 4 and remain on the charts for 17 weeksbetween 1968 and 1977 lewis had 17 top 10 hit singles on the billboard country chart including four charttoppers hits include whats made milwaukee famous has made a loser out of me to make love sweeter for you she still comes around to love whats left of me since i met you baby once more with feeling one has my name the other has my heart and sometimes a memory aint enough the production on his early country albums such as another place another time and she even woke me up to say goodbye was sparse quite different from the slick nashville sound that was predominant on country radio at the time and also expressed a full commitment by lewis to a country audience the songs still featured lewiss inimitable piano flourishes but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneers effortlessly soulful vocals which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time such as george jones and merle haggard in his book jerry lee lewis his own story biographer rick bragg notes that the songs lewis was recording were of the kind they were starting to call hard country not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way but because it was more substantial than the cloying overproduced mess out there on country radioin a remarkable turnaround lewis became the most bankable country star in the world he was so huge in 1970 that his former smash producer shelby singleton who purchased sun records from sam phillips in july 1969 wasted no time in repackaging many of lewiss old country recordings with such effectiveness that many fans assumed they were recent releases one of his later unreleased sun recordings one minute past eternity was issued as a single and soared to number 2 on the country chart following lewiss recent mercury hit she even woke me up to say goodbye singleton would milk these unreleased recordings for years following the golden cream of the country with a taste of country later in 1970lewis played the grand ole opry only once on january 20 1973 as colin escott writes in the liner notes to a half century of hits he had maintained an ambivalence to music city ever since he was turned away as an aspiring musician before his glory days at sun records it was 18 years since he had left nashville broke and disheartenedlewis was never truly accepted in nashville he didnt move there and didnt schmooze there he didnt fit in with the family values crowd lewis family values werent necessarily worse but they were differentas recounted in a 2015 online rolling stone article by beville dunkerly lewis opened with his comeback single another place another time ignoring his allotted time constraints—and thus commercial breaks—lewis played for 40 minutes the average opry performance is two songs for about eight minutes of stage time maximum and invited del wood—the one member of the opry who had been kind to him when he had been there as a teenager—out on stage to sing with him he also blasted through whole lotta shakin going on workin man blues good golly miss molly and a number of other classicslewis returned to the pop charts with me and bobby mcgee in 1971 and chantilly lace in 1972 and this coupled with a revitalized public interest in vintage rock and roll inspired mercury to fly lewis to london in 1973 to record with a cadre of british and irish musicians including rory gallagher kenney jones and albert lee by all accounts the sessions were tense the remake of lewiss old sun cut drinking wine spodeeodee was the albums hit single reaching number 20 on the billboard country chart and peaking at number 41 on the pop chart the session was his highest pop charting album since 1964s golden hits of jerry lee lewis hitting number 37 it did far better on the country albums chart rising to number 4 later that year he went to memphis and recorded southern roots back home to memphis a soulinfused rock album produced by huey meaux according to rick braggs authorized 2014 biography the killer was in a foul mood when he showed up at trans maximus studios in memphis to record during these sessions he insulted the producer threatened to kill a photographer and drank and medicated his way into but not out of a fog during one exchange that can be heard on the 2013 reissue southern roots the original sessions meaux asks lewis do you wan na try one meaning a take to which lewis replies if you got enough fuckin sense to cut it lewis was still pumping out country albums although the hits were beginning to dry up his last big hit with mercury was middle age crazy which made it to number 4 in 1977in 1979 lewis switched record labels to elektra and produced the critically acclaimed jerry lee lewis although sales were disappointing in 1986 lewis was one of the inaugural inductees into the rock and roll hall of fame although looking frail after several hospitalizations due to stomach problems lewis was responsible for beginning an unplanned jam at the end of the evening which was incorporated into all future events that year he returned to sun studio in memphis to team up with orbison cash and perkins along with longtime admirers like john fogerty to create the album class of 55in 1989 a major motion picture based on his early life in rock and roll great balls of fire brought him back into the public eye especially when he decided to rerecord all his songs for the movie soundtrack the film was based on the book by lewiss exwife myra gale lewis and starred dennis quaid as lewis winona ryder as myra and alec baldwin as jimmy swaggart the movie focuses on lewiss early career and his relationship with myra and ends with the scandal of the late 1950s a year later in 1990 lewis made minor news when a new song he recorded called it was the whiskey talkin not me was included in the soundtrack to the hit movie dick tracy the song is also heard in the movie playing on the radio the public downfall of his cousin televangelist jimmy swaggart around the same time resulted in more adverse publicity to a troubled family swaggart is also a piano player as is another cousin country music star mickey gilley all three listened to the same music in their youth and frequented haneys big house the ferriday club that featured black blues acts lewis and swaggart had a complex relationship over the yearsin 1998 lewis toured europe with chuck berry and little richard on february 12 2005 he was given a lifetime achievement award by the recording academy on september

week at the country music hall of fame in nashville adding that his career had taught him to be a good person and treat people rightlewis was an incendiary showman who often played with his fists elbows feet and backside sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire like chuck berrys guitar playing lewiss piano style became synonymous with rock and roll having influenced generations of piano playersin a 2013 interview with leah harper elton john recalls that up until great balls of fire the piano playing that i had heard had been more sedate my dad collected george shearing records but this was the first time i heard someone beat the shit out of a piano when i saw little richard at the harrow granada he played it standing up but jerry lee lewis actually jumped on the piano this was astonishing to me that people could do that those records had such a huge effect on me and they were just so great i learned to play like that lewis was primarily known for his boogiewoogie style which is characterized by a regular lefthand bass figure and dancing beat but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart appearing on memphis sounds with george klein in 2011 lewis credited his older pianoplaying cousin carl mcvoy as being a crucial influence stating he was a great piano player a great singer and a nicelooking man carried himself real well i miss carl very much lewis also cited moon mullican as a source of inspiration although almost entirely selftaught lewis conceded to biographer rich bragg in

heated exchange during the famous million dollar quartet jam involving lewis elvis presley carl perkins and johnny cash they performed several gospel songs lewiss biographer rick bragg explains that part of the reason the recording only features lewis and elvis singing is because only elvis and jerry lee raised in the assembly of god and johnny and carl didnt really know the words they was baptists said and therefore deprivedin the 1990 documentary the jerry lee lewis story lewis said to the interviewer the bible doesnt even speak of religion no word of religion is even in the bible
