1966 writing most of the bands bestknown originals from this period including ill feel a whole lot better she dont care about time eight miles high and set you free this time although he did not achieve commercial success as a solo artist clark was in the vanguard of popular music during much of his career prefiguring developments in such disparate subgenres as psychedelic rock baroque pop newgrass country rock and alternative country he was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1991 as a member of the byrdsclark was born in tipton missouri the third of 13 children in a family of irish german and native american heritage his family moved to kansas city missouri where as a boy he began learning to play the guitar and harmonica from his father he was soon playing hank williams tunes as well as songs by early rockers such as elvis presley and the everly brothers he began writing songs at the age of 11 by the time he was 15 he had developed a rich tenor voice and he formed a local rock and roll combo joe meyers and the sharks like many of his generation clark developed an interest in folk music because of the popularity of the kingston trio when he graduated from bonner springs high school in bonner springs kansas in 1962 he formed a folk group the rum runnersclark was invited to join an established regional folk band the surf riders based in kansas city at the castaways lounge owned by hal harbaum on august 12 1963 he was performing with them when he was discovered by the new christy minstrels they hired him and he recorded two albums with the ensemble before leaving in early 1964 after hearing the beatles clark quit the new christy minstrels and moved to los angeles where he met fellow folkie and beatles convert jim later roger mcguinn at the troubadour club in early 1964 they began to assemble a band that would become the byrdsclark wrote or cowrote many of the byrds bestknown originals from their first three albums including ill feel a whole lot better set you free this time here without you you wont have to cry if youre gone the world turns all around her she dont care about time and eight miles high he initially played rhythm guitar in the band but relinquished that position to david crosby and became the tambourine and harmonica player bassist chris hillman noted years later in an interview remembering clark at one time he was the power in the byrds not mcguinn not crosby—it was gene who would burst through the stage curtain banging on a tambourine coming on like a young prince valiant a hero our savior few in the audience could take their eyes off this presence he was the songwriter he had the gift that none of the rest of us had developed yet what deep inner part of his soul conjured up songs like set you free this time ill feel a whole lot better im feelin higher eight miles high so many great songs we learned a lot of songwriting from him and in the process learned a little bit about ourselvesa management decision gave mcguinn the lead vocals for their major singles and bob dylan songs this disappointment combined with clarks dislike of traveling including a chronic fear of flying and resentment by other band members about the extra income he derived from his songwriting led to internal squabbling and he left the group in early 1966 he briefly returned to kansas city before moving back to los angeles to form gene clark the group with chip douglas joel larson and bill rhinehartcolumbia records the byrds record label signed clark as a solo artist and in 1967 he released his first solo album gene clark with the gosdin brothers the gosdin brothers were selected to back him because they shared the same manager jim dickson and because chris hillman who played bass on the album had worked with the gosdin brothers in the mid1960s when he and they were members of the southern california bluegrass band the hillmen the album was a unique mixture of pop country rock and baroque psychedelic tracks it received favorable reviews but unfortunately for clark it was released almost simultaneously with the byrds younger than yesterday also on columbia and partly because of his 18month absence from public attention was a commercial failurewith the future of his solo career in doubt clark briefly rejoined the byrds in october 1967 as a replacement for the recently departed david crosby following an anxiety attack in minneapolis he left after only three weeks during this brief period with the byrds he appeared with the band on the smothers brothers comedy hour lipsynching the groups current single goin back he also performed mr spaceman with the band although there is some disagreement among the bands biographers clark is generally viewed as having contributed background vocals to the songs goin back and space odyssey for the forthcoming byrds album the notorious byrd brothers and was an uncredited coauthor with mcguinn of get to you also from that albumin 1968 clark signed with am records and began a collaboration with the banjo player doug dillard guitarist bernie leadon later with the flying burrito brothers and the eagles bassist dave jackson and mandolinist don beck joined them to form the nucleus of dillard clark in addition michael clarke briefly drummed for the group before joining the flying burrito brothers they produced two albums the fantastic expedition of dillard clark 1968 and through the morning through the night 1969the fantastic expedition of dillard clark was a pivotal work of acoustic country rock it included such enduring songs as train leaves here this morning a collaboration between clark and leadon prominently covered by the latter in 1972 on the eagles debut album and she darked the sun covered by linda ronstadt on her 1970 album silk purse in contrast through the morning through the night was more indebted to traditional bluegrass but also employed electric instrumentation by this juncture dillards girlfriend donna washburn had joined the group as a backing vocalist a factor that precipitated the departure of leadon the shift to traditional bluegrass also caused clark to lose interest written by clark the title song was used by quincy jones in the soundtrack of the 1972 sam peckinpah film the getaway it was also covered by robert plant and alison krauss along with polly another clarkpenned track from the album on their 2007 album raising sand both albums by dillard clark fared poorly on the charts but they are now regarded as seminal exemplars of the country rock and progressive bluegrass genresthe collaboration with dillard rejuvenated clarks creativity but greatly contributed to his growing drinking problem dillard clark disintegrated in late 1969 after the departures of clark and leadon during this period clark leadon jackson and beck contributed to the debut album of steve young rock salt nails released in november 1969in 1970 clark began work on a new single recording two tracks with the original members of the byrds each recording his part separately the resulting songs shes the kind of girl and one in a hundred were not released at the time because of legal problems they were included later on the 1973 album roadmaster in 1970 and 1971 clark contributed vocals and two compositions tried so hard and here tonight to albums by the flying burrito brothersfrustrated with the music industry clark bought a house in albion california and married former gogo dancer and bell records production assistant carlie lynn mccummings in june 1970

ten hit you showed me a previously unreleased composition by mcguinn and clark from 1964 rearranged for the band by chip douglasin 1971 clark released his second solo album white light the title was not on the cover sleeve and thus some later reviewers mistakenly assumed that the title was gene clark the album was produced by the native american guitarist jesse ed davis with whom clark developed a great rapport partly due to their common ancestry an intimate poetic and mostly acoustic work supplemented by daviss slide guitar the album contained many introspective tracks such as with tomorrow because of you where my love lies asleep and for a spanish guitar which bob dylan reportedly hailed as one of the greatest songs ever written all of the material was written by clark with the exception of bob dylan and richard manuels tears of rage launched to considerable critical acclaim the album failed to gain commercial success except in the netherlands where it was voted album of the year by rock music critics once more modest promotion and clarks refusal to undertake promotional touring adversely affected salesin the spring of 1971 clark was commissioned by dennis hopper to contribute the tracks american dreamer and outlaw song to american dreamer a documentary that chronicled the fractious editing process of the last movie a rerecorded longer version of the song american dreamer was later used in the 1977 film the farmer along with an instrumental version of the same song plus outside the law the outlaw a rerecording of outlaw songin 1972 clark attempted to record a followup album progress was slow and expensive and am terminated the project before completion the resulting eight tracks including full circle song and in a misty morning along with those recorded with the byrds in 1970 and 1971 shes the kind of girl and one in a hundred and with the flying burrito brothers here tonight were released in 1973 as roadmaster in the netherlands onlyclark left am in late 1972 to join a reunion of the original five byrds they cut the album byrds which was released in march 1973 by asylum records while the album charted relatively well us no 20 its placement did not live up to the labels initial expectations in the wake of the recent success of crosby crosby stills nash young and hillman a member of stephen stillss band manassas clarks compositions full circle and changing heart and the neil young covers on which he sang the lead vocal see the sky about to rain and cowgirl in the sand were widely regarded as the standout tracks on the critically divisive album disheartened by the bad reviews and unhappy with crosbys performance as the records producer the group members chose to dissolve the band clark briefly joined mcguinns solo group with which he premiered silver raven arguably his most celebrated postbyrds songon the basis of the quality of clarks contributions to byrds david geffen signed him to asylum records in early 1974 the label was the home of the most prominent exponents of the singersongwriter movement of the era and carried the kind of hip cachet that clark hadnt experienced since his days with the byrds while composing the album he spent long periods with a notebook and an acoustic guitar at the picture window of his home deriving inspiration from staring at the pacific oceanproduced by thomas jefferson kaye with a vast array of session musicians including members of the section and the allman brothers band and backing singers the ensuing no other fused elements of country rock folk gospel soul and choral music with poetic mystical lyrics although the album was praised by critics its unconventional arrangements which anticipated the later innovations of lindsey buckingham stevie nicks and christine mcvie limited public appeal furthermore its high production costs exceeding 100000 prompted geffen to publicly berate clark and kaye the album was minimally promoted and stalled in the billboard album chart at no 144 in 2013 members of the bands beach house the walkmen grizzly bear and fleet foxes performed the album in its entirety in a series of concertsclarks return to los angeles to record the album resulted in his reversion to a hedonistic lifestyle and accelerated the disintegration of his marriage disillusioned by professional and marital failure he mounted his first solo tour by road playing colleges and clubs with roger white lead guitar and backing vocals and duke bardwell electric bass backing vocals and acoustic guitar the drumless trio was billed as gene clark and the silveradosin 2019 a remasteredremixed version of no other was releasedafter the commercial failure of no other clark was confused about his artistic direction throughout 1975 and 1976 he had hinted to the press that he was assembling a set of cosmic songs fusing country rock with rb and funk elaborating on the soundscapes of his most recent album in 1976 he recorded a set of ten demos that combined country and folk music with a light touch of cosmic consciousness these were submitted to rso records which promptly bought out clarks asylum contract and issued the longgestating two sides to every story in 1977 the album—a melange of bluegrass traditional honky tonk echoes of no other sister moon and strident country rock a new arrangement of kansas city southern—was produced by kaye with an understated touchthe emotional fallout from his divorce is reflected in the album title and several of clarks compositions including the aforementioned sister moon lonely saturday past addresses silent crusade and hear the wind the album also contains covers of the traditional in the pines a key component of clarks live repertoire with the silverados and give my love to marie by james talley once again his style of sensitive balladry failed to achieve success on the us charts in a belated attempt to find an appreciative public he reluctantly overcame his travel anxiety and launched an international promotional tour with the kc southern band some six weeks before his death in 1991 clark told interviewer bill wasserzieher that he considered two sides to every story his best album rivaled only by no otherfor his british tour dates clark found himself on the same bill as exbyrds roger mcguinn and chris hillman each fronting their own bands shortly after returning to the united states clark and mcguinn began touring as an acoustic duo after hillman joined his former bandmates the reformed trio named themselves mcguinn clark hillman and signed with capitol records produced by the albert brothers who had recently recorded crosby stills nashs 1977 comeback album the ensuing mcguinn clark hillman 1979 was a rebirth in both performing and songwriting for clark who ensconced himself as the groups dominant creative force he wrote four songs for the album including backstage pass a rumination on the ennui of touring and his fear of flying release me girl a discoinflected collaboration with thomas jefferson kaye the ufoinspired feelin higher and little mamamany critics felt that the albums slick production and discoinfluenced soft rock rhythms didnt flatter the group but the album reached no 39 on the billboard 200 underpinned by the mcguinnpenned dont you write her off which peaked at no 33 in may 1979 and earned a riaa gold certification selling well enough to generate a followup mcguinn clark and hillmans second release was to have been a full group effort entitled city although it was ultimately released in 1980 a combination of clarks unreliability including experimentation with heroin and his dissatisfaction with their musical direction mostly regarding ron and howard alberts production resulted in the album being credited to roger mcguinn chris hillman featuring gene clark despite the turmoil clark penned the song wont let you down by 1981 clark had left and the group recorded one more album as mcguinnhillmanclark moved to hawaii with jesse ed davis to try to overcome his drug dependency remaining there until the end of 1981 upon his return to los angeles he assembled a new band the firebyrds and in 1982 proceeded to record what would eventually become the album firebyrd while waiting for the album to be released clark joined up with chris hillman and others in an abortive venture called flyte which failed to secure a recording contract and was quickly dissolved the eventual release of firebyrd in 1984 coincided with the emergence of jangle rockers like rem and tom petty who had sparked a new interest in the byrds clark also began developing new fans among las rootsconscious paisley underground scene later in the decade he embraced his new status by appearing as a guest with the long ryders in a session arranged by saul davis and he cut an acclaimed duo album with carla olson of the textones titled so rebellious a lover including the notable gypsy rider and del gato in 1986 the album included contributions from chris hillman stephen mccarthy of the long ryders and randy fuller of the bobby fuller four and was produced and arranged by session drummer michael hueyin 1985 clark approached mcguinn crosby and hillman regarding a reformation of the byrds in time for the 20th anniversary of the release of mr tambourine man the three of them showed no interest clark decided to assemble a superstar collection of musicians including exflying burrito brothers and firefall member rick roberts exbeach boys singer and guitarist blondie chaplin exband members rick danko and richard manuel and exbyrds michael clarke and john york clark initially called his band the 20th anniversary tribute to the byrds and began performing on the lucrative nostalgia circuit in early 1985 a number of concert promoters began to shorten the bands name to the byrds in advertisements and promotional material as the band continued to tour throughout 1985 their agent decided to shorten the name to the byrds permanently to the displeasure of mcguinn crosby and hillman clark eventually discontinued performing with his own byrds band but drummer clarke continued on with skip battin occasionally with exbyrds york and gene parsons forming another byrds group prompting mcguinn hillman and crosby to go on the road as the byrds in an attempt to establish a claim to the rights to the name their effort failed this time clark was not included in the reunion primarily because of his involvement with the act that didnt include them crosby finally secured rights to the name in 2002despite the critical success of so rebellious a lover which led to several tv appearances including nashville now clark was increasingly afflicted with serious health problems including ulcers and alcohol dependence in 1988 he underwent surgery to remove a malignant ulcera period of abstinence and recovery followed until tom petty covered ill feel a whole lot better on full moon fever 1989 yielding a windfall of royalties from the album which peaked at no 3 in the united states to clark flush with money he began to neglect his professional obligations although the
