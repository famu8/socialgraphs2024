hendersonville tennessee two of their daughters – helen and anita – are buried nearbyaccording to statements made by carter during a transcribed public performance she began studying guitar at age 13 when she acquired an instrument she is often cited as a pioneering musician being both an early female guitarist with national exposure and one of the first to use the guitar as a lead instrument in country musicwriters have identified at least three or four styles played by maybelle carter she often tuned her guitar down sometimes as many as five frets but sometimes used a capo to increase the instruments range her most famous and widely recorded style is sometimes called the carter scratch or thumblead style this technique involved playing a melody on the instruments three bass strings while strumming the three treble strings for rhythm she used thumb and finger picks while playinganother style later popularized by other musicians was essentially the reverse of the thumblead style in this style carter fingerpicked a melody on the three treble strings while brushing a rhythm on the bass strings with her thumb it is often said that she first saw this style played by african american musician lesley riddle a third style of carters guitar playing involved rapid flatpicking in a country blues rhythm her most obscure style was utilized on a few recordings by the original carter family in the 1920s and early 1930s it may be described as a hawaiianinfluenced slide technique that sometimes sounded like a modern dobro finally if other musicians were playing a lead instrument maybelle would often strum chords on the guitar to accompany them maybelle once filled in for jimmie rodgers during a recording session perfectly mimicking his guitar playing style in 1932 rodgers was ill with tuberculosis at that time and had waning stamina during the sessioncarter recorded her signature guitar piece wildwood flower on numerous occasions beginning with the original 1928 version the cannon ball recorded with the original carter family in 1930 illustrates carters fingerpicking style with thumbbass fill her final recording in the slide guitar style was my old

and sweet allie leethe autoharp was relatively obscure in the earliest days of recorded country music the original carter family often used the instrument for rhythm still it was played by maybelle carters cousin and bandmate sara carter in her intricate style maybelle carter is widely credited with the autoharps popularity and it is still played in country and roots music the autoharp was maybelles first instrument she began tinkering with it as early as the age of four but did not turn a serious focus toward the instrument until around 1940traditionally the autoharp was strummed as a rhythm instrument maybelle developed alone or perhaps independently of other musicians who did the same a pinch and pluck technique that forms the basis of most modern autoharp playing styles this technique allows for playing melodic lead notes on the instrument carters style later evolved to add a fillin rhythm similar to her guitar technique while playing the autoharp maybelle would often press cord bars between notes the effect was a note slurring a sound similar to a guitar hammeron it has been said that pianist floyd cramer was especially interested in these embellishments to maybelles playing and that they helped to shape his piano techniqueas she began to feature the autoharp more and more in concerts and radio work carter became frustrated with trying to steady the instrument close enough to a microphone often shared by others she utilized tables and music stands at first but later got the idea of holding the instrument upside down across her chest and playing along what was essentially the head of the harp nearest the tuning pegs before then musicians played below the cord bars at the opposite end she discovered this technique allowed more space for her complicated playing style and produced a sweeter tone during at least one public performance maybelle stated that autoharps were manufactured differently to accommodate the playing style she popularizedmaybelle carter taught at least one workshop on autoharp playing in conjunction with her various appearances at newport folk festivals a moderator at the workshop noted that maybelle should be credited with the first fingerpicked autoharp solo to be captured on commercial recording referencing fair and tender ladies recorded by the carter sisters and mother maybelle on columbia records about 1950 she often played the autoharp in that group other examples include a simplistic but moving solo she added to mountain lady on the familys final album before her death in addition to recordings with the carter sisters which featured her autoharp playing maybelle carter often featured the instrument in her solo work on her earliest solo album she offered an old fiddle tune liberty for the session later smash records issued an album of autoharp solos by maybelle carter which included a few backing musicians and subtle background vocals by the stephen scott singers green valley waltz and barbara allen were included along with ten other titles the bulk of her final solo album from 1973 was composed of autoharp solos in which a whole band of studio musicians accompanied hermother maybelle frequently found studio work with other artists to capture the fresh sound she had created she recorded at least two songs with johnnie jack and at least two with the wilburn brothers the latter collaboration registered a topten hit to which maybelle carter was not credited go away with me she also played autoharp on carl smiths sunday down south gospel album a similar pairing with flatt scruggs led to the songs of the famous carter family album on which maybelle contributed mostly through her autoharp playing in the 1960s maybelle helped record an instructional record sold with an autoharp through a mailorder chain store she contributed a demonstration of the instrument and a small amount of dialoguethe moniker original carter family predates the original groups breakup by several years being used during their radio programs on mexican border stations other groups used the name carter family so adding original helped distinguish the trio eventually the name original carter family came to be used to differentiate between the original trio formed in the 1920s and later versions of the group particularly maybelle and her daughters maybelle carter worked with the original carter family from about 1926 until about 1943 when the group officially disbanded on personal appearances radio shows and commercial recordings the group reunited for a performance in may 1953 at the first jimmie rodgers memorial festival they sang two songs with a p carter serving as emcee for their portion of the program the performance was captured on a home movie camera but the film deteriorated in storage an audio recording of the performance does survive maybelle sang on two or three of the first six songs recorded by the family in 1927 initially her vocal contributions to the group were mostly subdued but she gradually took on a more prominent role it became routine for her to harmonize with the whole trio she and sara carter frequently sang duets without a pin 1937 the two recorded a duet on hello stranger which featured both voices equally in an unusual callandresponse vocal arrangement maybelle sang opening phrases for all verses on the groups 1940 recording of ill never forsake you during their final commercial session maybelles voice was slightly dominant to saras on selections such as why do you cry little darling you tied a love knot in my heart and youre gon na be sorry you let me down she rarely sing lead for the group on radio shows but sometimes played and sang solos in the mid1960s through the early 1970s maybelle and sara would periodically reunite for personal appearances and television work recording an album for columbia during this time as wellfollowing a p carters death in 1960 the group previously known as the carter sisters and mother maybelle assumed carter family as their official band name maybelle carter performed with this group mostly with her three daughters but in various other versions of the group as well from the late 1930s and early 1940s almost until she died in 1978 they toured did many radio programs and tv appearances and made several commercial recordings together as the carter sisters mother maybelle the group made their first commercial recordings for rca victor in 1949 the sales were better than average but produced no major hits those recordings were among the first to be issued in the new 45rpm single formatmaybelle sang lead on a number of the rca recordings including my darlings home at last why do you weep dear willow walk a little closer dont wait and ive got a home up in glory one of the more popular recordings of that era to feature maybelle was someones last day on a radio transcription the emcee notes that she gets more requests for it than any of them by the early 1950s the group changed labels to columbia in that era maybelle frequently sang a verse on a song with her daughters singing others likely the most popular recording from that era was a single featuring fair and tender ladies on one side and foggy mountain top on the otherin the early 1960s the group featuring maybelle and her daughters now called simply the carter family moved to the liberty label where they had an album and at least one single released shortly after they returned to columbia where the group remained under contract throughout maybelles life it was on columbia that almost all the groups significantly successful discs were released maybelles role as a vocal soloist was diminished during this time but she did a lot of harmony singing on those recordings she would periodically sing whole songs or verses within songs examples include homestead on the farm on the groups the country album picture on the wall from the three generations collection and an enduring rendition of will the circle be unbroken on their keep on the sunny side albumthe album mother maybelle carter on the briar label was the first commercial recording to feature maybelle as a headliner it was recorded in 1959 but was not released until a couple of years later maybelle recruited the help of her daughters helen and anita as backing vocalists group members often utilized other family members on their various solo recordings some singles were released from the album and a slightly edited version of the album was later released under the title queen of the autoharp on the kapp label that transaction offered a more robust distribution maybelle sang several interesting selections including sweeter than the flowers and my native home someone suggested adding the carter scratch to a reverberating electric guitar on some of the tracks the strange effect was a carter family beach music sound maybelle filled out the album with other vocal performances and some instrumentalsin the early to mid1960s maybelle carters solo work was recorded by mercury records and released on its subsidiary labels smash and cumberland there were three albums and at least one nonalbum single representative solo vocals from those recordings include faded coat of blue flowers blooming in the wildwood and nobodys darling on earth a single strumming my guitaro also featured
