vocals fourpart arrangements and its highenergy shows wellseasoned with humor the quintets early years saw the band gathering around one microphone employing a shellgame choreography for solos and backup which keeps the show visually active as well as aurally pleasing although the most recent configuration is more traditional with individual microphones for instruments and vocals andes clear singing style is attributed to the unique stylings of charlie waller whose earthy bassbaritone voice sang with clear enunciation farris sings a bold tenor harmony remarkable for its projection his powerful delivery has been likened to the late john duffey of the seldom scene shorter occasionally sings baritone harmonies an octave higher while davis sings bass vocals more on gospel songs in
