also contributedmessina originally intended to lend his name to the loggins project only to help introduce the unknown loggins to messinas wellestablished buffalo springfield and poco audiences but by the time the album was completed messina had contributed so much to the album in terms of songwriting arrangement instrumentation and vocals that an accidental duo was born thus the full name of their

radio upon release it eventually found success by fall 1972 particularly on college campuses where the pair toured heavily loggins and messinas vocal harmonies meshed so well that what was begun as a oneoff album became an entity in itself audiences regarded the pair as a genuine duo rather than as a solo act with a wellknown producer instead of continuing to produce loggins as a sole performer they decided to record as a duo loggins messinawhen our first album sittin in came out we started receiving a lot of excitement about the music and good sales messina recalled in 2005we had a choice it was either i now go on and continue to produce him and we do the solo career or we stay together and let this work for me i did not desire to go back out on the road i had had enough of that and i wanted to produce records but clive davis then president of the record company intervened and said you know i think youd be making a mistake if you guys didnt take this opportunity things like this only happen once in a lifetime it may merit you sleeping on it overnight and making a decision that will be in your best interest he was absolutely correct kenny made the decision as well it delayed his solo career but it gave him an opportunity i think to have oneboth members of the duo were guitarists loggins played rhythm guitar with both acoustic and electric guitar and harmonica and messina
