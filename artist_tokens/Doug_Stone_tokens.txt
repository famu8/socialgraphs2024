review saying that since stones voice is pleasant the music is often pleasant but its hardly memorable andy turner of country standard time was more favorable saying that it does not come off too

music a biographical dictionary richard carlin describes him as a solid country crooner whose style is reminiscent of merle haggard steve huey of allmusic wrote that stone made his name as a lonesome baritone balladeer though hes also adept at hard uptempo country zell miller author of they heard georgia singing wrote that stone has established himself as a mellow country crooner who is known as mr sensitive and the dean martin of country music because of his unique flair for communicating the fragility of a broken heart with his delicate baritone voice and laidback stylekurt wolff of country music the rough guide described stones musical style less favorably he wrote that stone seemed schizophrenic half his reputation was established with selfdeprecating downers like id be better off in a pine box but then hed just as easily turn around with a schmaltzy love song like too busy being in love he compared id be better off and warning labels favorably to haggard as well and thought that the change of producers on more love gave him a much beefier sound
