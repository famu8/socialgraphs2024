criticized the usual overproduction that characterizes nashville in the 90s joel bernstein of country standard time was mixed toward the album as well he thought that i said a prayer sounded like a

several years prior walker and worley alternated production duties with dann huff and kenny greenberg the only chart entry off thunder roses was please which peaked at number 22 on the billboard country chart kevin oliver of country standard time described please as one of those uplifting slice of life anthems that sounds great on the radio and connects with women on some level that men will never completely understand he also thought the album as a whole had a strong yet deft touch tillis herself cited the song as one that would appeal to single womentillis exited arista nashville in early 2002 citing both the expiration of her contract and her dissatisfaction with arista executives prioritizing songs that had potential radio success over songs she wanted to record after exiting

window despite not officially promoting it as a single she coproduced the project with singersongwriter gary nicholson kevin oliver of country standard time found influences of rock music and jazz stating that the album was widely varied and enjoyable the christmas album previously available only at her concerts was released later in the year as just in time for christmas it featured a mix of christmas standards and original content also in 2007 the country music hall of fame opened an exhibition called its all relative featuring artifacts from mel and pams music careerstillis started a tour in 2008 that included regina saskatchewan dates in january for this tour she sang both her and her fathers songs along with album cuts and new material she recorded no other albums until 2012s recollection which comprised rerecordings of her hit singles from arista nashville she chose to do this when noticing how dated she thought some of her old songs sounded and relied on her road band to provide instrumentation after she booked tour dates with lorrie morgan the two artists decided to record a collaborative album called dos divas in 2013 the album included a mix of solo songs from each artist as well as a number of duets they also toured together to promote this album on a tour called grits and glamour a second collaborative album come see me and come lonely followed in 2017 also at

well as a cover of gillian welch and david rawlingss dark turn of mind on june 29 2022 tillis had been nominated for induction into the nashville songwriters hall of fame alongside kirk franklin brad paisley and shania twain though twain ultimately received the honorcolin larkin wrote in the virgin encyclopedia of country music in 1999 that her powerful vocal styling may not suit everybody he also wrote at the time that it still remains to be seen whether she can really establish herself with the hardline country traditionalists the editors of the encyclopedia of country music described tillis as a vocal stylistpairing contemporary country lyrics with traditional country vocals paving the way for such singers as mindy mccready tillis described her own vocal style as not the twangiest country singer out there as she thought her voice also contained rhythm and blues and rock phrasings roch parisien of allmusic described her voice as pure fullbodied country and a genuinely throaty twang despite considering it exaggerated to the point of annoyance on do you know where your man is steven wine reviewing looking for a feeling for the associated press said that she has mastered the art of singing without raising her voice she swoops and slides yes but most of all she smolders an alto with a blue hue alanna nash of entertainment weekly wrote of sweethearts dance that moving beyond the attention she gained from her kewpie doll face and piercing soprano she ’ s gone the distance to incorporate all of her musical past into the country framework for an updated 90s feel robert k oermann in the book behind the grand ole opry curtain tales of romance and tragedy described tillis as having a torrid soprano vivid songwriting and enchanting witwriters have taken notice of tilliss use of wordplay in her material reviewing all of this love for country standard time joel bernstein noted tilliss affinity for wordplay in her song titles such as on that albums tequila mockingbird nash criticized the song for similar reasons and kevin john coyne of country universe cited blue rose is as another example of wordplay bernstein also thought of her decision to produce all of this love by herself that tastefulness continues to be tillis trademark in an interview with country universe in 2020 tillis stated that her later albums featured fewer songs she wrote than her earlier albums due to her own criticism of her work she ultimately decided to start cowriting again on looking for a feeling because she considered her own writing to be words out of heart nash reviewing collection in 1994 thought that because the album contained material recorded earlier in her career it lacked the plucky personality and the supercharged vocals that now punch their way out of the radio both nash and larry crowley of the arizona republic thought that spilled perfume which is about one woman confronting another over a onenight stand displayed feminist themes coyne thought that put yourself in my place showed an unusual amount of artistic freedom for a new country music act in the 1990s he considered maybe it was memphis to be her signature song stating that its fiery performance and the aggressive production still sound fresh todaybeing the daughter of a country musician she was regularly compared to her father because of this she told the associated press in 2017 that she felt the best advice to give to an aspiring musician was be yourself she also said that her father exposed her to other musical influences besides himself such as patsy cline and loretta lynn despite this she also noted that her father was very strict about what music she could listen to and what concerts she could attend as a child specifically she stated that her listening to the beatles alienated him in addition she stated that differences in musical tastes were what ended her role as his backing vocalist of her attempts to establish a musical identity separate from her father colin

several other country music singers made guest appearances she also had cameo appearances in the nbc crime show la law along with episodes of diagnosis murder and promised land on cbs of acting tillis said that she did not find it considerably different from singing because both roles require taking the raw material of emotion and making something out of it in 1999 she appeared in the broadway revue smokey joes cafe where she and others performed various show tunes by jerry leiber and mike stoller of doing so tillis stated at the time that she wanted to branch out and took a role in the
