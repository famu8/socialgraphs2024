culture but developed independently the ceremonial complex represents a major component of the religion of the mississippian peoples it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understoodamong the historical tribes of native american people living in presentday alabama at the time of european contact were the cherokee an iroquoian language people and the muskogeanspeaking

alabama joined nathan bedford forrests battalion in hopkinsville kentucky the company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves collar and coattails this led to them being greeted with yellowhammer and the name later was applied to all alabama troops in the confederate armyalabamas slaves were freed by the 13th amendment in 1865 alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in may 1865 until its official restoration to the union in 1868 from 1867 to 1874 with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised many african americans emerged as political leaders in the state alabama was represented in congress during this period by three africanamerican congressmen jeremiah haralson benjamin s turner and james t rapierfollowing the war the state remained chiefly agricultural with an economy tied to cotton during reconstruction state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 which created the states first public school system and expanded womens rights legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation organized insurgent resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans these groups included the ku klux klan the pale faces knights of the white camellia red shirts and the white leaguereconstruction in alabama ended in 1874 when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governors office through an election dominated by fraud and violence they wrote another constitution in 1875 and the legislature passed the blaine amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religiousaffiliated schools the same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891the new 1901 constitution of alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population including nearly all african americans and native americans and tens of thousands of poor european americans through making voter registration difficult requiring a poll tax and literacy test the 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools by 1903 only 2980 african americans were registered in alabama although at least 74000 were literate this compared to more than 181000 african americans eligible to vote in 1900 the numbers dropped even more in later decades the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s jails were segregated in 1911 hospitals in 1915 toilets hotels and restaurants in 1928 and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax by 1941 whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws 600000 whites vs 520000 african americans nearly all blacks had lost the ability to vote despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizensthe ruraldominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds which paid onethird of the construction costs the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas they often donated land and labor as wellbeginning in 1913 the first 80 rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african american children a total of 387 schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic placescontinued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the great migration out of the south reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920at the same time many rural people migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the magic city by 1920 birmingham was the 36thlargest city in the united states heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy its residents were underrepresented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution this did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court orderbeginning in the 1940s when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters the alabama legislature took several countersteps designed to disfranchise black voters the legislature passed and the voters ratified a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants black citizens in mobile successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the fifteenth amendment the legislature also changed the boundaries of tuskegee to a 28sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits the supreme court unanimously held that this racial gerrymandering violated the constitution in 1961 the alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local electionsindustrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile between 1940 and 1943 more than 89000 people moved into the city to work for warrelated industries cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service basedespite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961 the ruraldominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas one result was that jefferson county containing birminghams industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than onethird of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive a proportional amount in services urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature a 1960 study noted that because of rural domination a minority of about 25 of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislaturein the united states supreme court cases of baker v carr 1962 and reynolds v sims 1964 the court ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic countiesafrican americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement including legal challenges in 1954 the us supreme court ruled in brown v board of education that public schools had to be desegregated but alabama was slow to comply during the 1960s under governor george wallace alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama including the montgomery bus boycott 1955–1956 freedom rides in 1961 and 1965 selma to montgomery marches these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 by the us congresslegal segregation ended in the states in 1964 but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court according to the new york times by 2017 many of alabamas african americans were living in alabamas cities such as birmingham and montgomery also the black belt region across central alabama is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly africanamerican these counties include dallas lowndes marengo and perryin 1972 for the first time since 1901 the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census this benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districtsalabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation in the 1980s an omnibus redistricting case dillard v crenshaw county challenged the atlarge voting for representative seats of 180 alabama jurisdictions including counties and school boards atlarge voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county as the majority tended to take all seats despite african americans making up a significant minority in the state they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the atlarge jurisdictionsas part of settlement of this case five alabama cities and counties including chilton county adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multiseat jurisdictions this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters in another form of proportional representation 23 jurisdictions use limited voting as in conecuh county in 1982 limited voting was first tested in conecuh county together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizensbeginning in the 1960s the states economy shifted away from its traditional lumber steel and textile industries because of increased foreign competition steel jobs for instance declined from 46314 in 1950 to 14185 in 2011 however the state particularly huntsville benefited from the opening of the george c marshall space flight center in 1960 a major facility in the development of the saturn rocket program and the space shuttle technology and manufacturing industries such as automobile assembly replaced some the states older industries in the late twentieth century but the states economy and growth lagged behind other states in the area such as georgia and floridain 2001 alabama supreme court chief justice roy moore installed a statue of the ten commandments in the capitol in montgomery in 2002 the 11th us circuit court ordered the statue removed but moore refused to follow the court order which

alabama constitution the current one having been adopted in 2022 the former alabama constitution adopted in 1901 was with over 850 amendments and almost 87000 words by some accounts the worlds longest constitution and roughly forty times the length of the united states constitutionthere has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize alabamas constitution critics have argued that alabamas constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature leaving practically no power in local hands most counties do not have home rule any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire alabama legislature and frequently by state referendum the former constitution was particularly criticized for its complexity and length intentionally codifying segregation and racismalabamas government is divided into three coequal branches the legislative branch is the alabama legislature a bicameral assembly composed of the alabama house of representatives with 105 members and the alabama senate with 35 members the legislature is responsible for writing debating passing or defeating state legislation the republican party currently holds a majority in both houses of the legislature the legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority most state legislatures require a twothirds majority to override a vetountil 1964 the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county with one per county it had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901 as a result urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses either in reynolds v sims 1964 the us supreme court implemented the principle of one man one vote ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented further the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systemsat that time alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas for instance birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied onethird of the state budget but jefferson county received only 167th of state services in funding through the legislative delegations the alabama legislature kept control of county governmentsthe executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws it is headed by the governor of alabama other members

executions per capita are significantly higher in texas some of its cases have been highly controversial the us supreme court has overturned 24 convictions in death penalty cases it was the only state

state was the focus of a 1941 u s supreme court ruling curry v united statesalabama has 67 counties each county has its own elected legislative branch usually called the county commission it also has limited executive authority in the county because of the constraints of the alabama constitution which centralizes power in the state legislature only seven counties jefferson lee mobile madison montgomery shelby and tuscaloosa in the state have limited home rule instead most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved ranging from waste disposal to land use zoningthe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties as recommended by the 1973 alabama constitutional commission legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county united states supreme court decisions in baker v carr 1964 required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population and redistricted after each census to implement the principle of one man one vote before that each county was represented by one state senator leading to underrepresentation in the state senate for more urbanized populous counties the rural bias of the state legislature which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house affected politics well into the 20th century failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areasthe lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation

salesduring reconstruction following the american civil war alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope in 1874 the political coalition of white democrats known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans in part by suppressing the black vote through violence fraud and intimidation after 1890 a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor whites by 1941 more whites than blacks had been disenfranchised 600000 to 520000 the total effects were greater on the black community as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the lawfrom 1901 through the 1960s the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas as counties were the basis of election districts the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly threequarters of the century until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement when whites bureaucratically and at times violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform governor george wallace the states only fourterm governor
