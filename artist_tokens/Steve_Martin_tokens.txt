french descent and grew up in inglewood california with his sister and then later in garden grove california in a baptist family steve was a cheerleader at garden grove high school one of his earliest memories is seeing his father as an extra serving drinks onstage at the callboard theater on melrose place in west hollywood california during world war ii in the united kingdom his father appeared in a production of our town with raymond massey expressing his affection through gifts like cars and bikes steves father was stern and not emotionally open to his son he was proud but critical with steve later recalling that in his teens his feelings for his father were mostly of hatredsteve martins first job was at disneyland selling guidebooks on weekends and fulltime during his schools summer break the work lasted for three years 1955–1958 during his free time he frequented the main street magic shop where tricks were demonstrated to patrons while working at disneyland he was captured in the background of the home movie that was made into the shortsubject film disneyland dream incidentally becoming his first film appearance by 1960 he had mastered several magic tricks and illusions and took a paying job at the magic shop in fantasyland in august there he perfected his talents for magic juggling and creating balloon animals in the manner of mentor wally boag frequently performing for tipsin his authorized biography close friend morris walker suggests that martin could be described most accurately as an agnostic he rarely went to church and was never involved in organized religion of his own volition in his early 20s martin dated melissa trumbo daughter of novelist and screenwriter dalton trumboafter high school martin attended santa ana college taking classes in drama and english poetry in his free time he teamed up with friend and garden grove high school classmate kathy westmoreland to participate in comedies and other productions at the bird cage theatre he joined a comedy troupe at knotts berry farm later he met budding actress stormie sherk and they developed comedy routines and became romantically involved sherks influence caused martin to apply to the california state university long beach for enrollment with a major in philosophy sherk enrolled at ucla about an hours drive north and the distance eventually caused them to lead separate livesinspired by his philosophy classes martin considered becoming a professor instead of an actorcomedian being at college changed his life it changed what i believe and what i think about everything i majored in philosophy something about non sequiturs appealed to me in philosophy i started studying logic and they were talking about cause and effect and you start to realize hey there is no cause and effect there is no logic there is no anything then it gets real easy to write this stuff because all you have to do is twist everything hard—you twist the punch line you twist the non sequitur so hard away from the things that set it up martin recalls reading a treatise on comedy that led him to think what if there were no punch lines what if there were no indicators what if i created tension and never released it what if i headed for a climax but all i delivered was an anticlimax what would the audience do with all that tension theoretically it would have to come out sometime but if i kept denying them the formality of a punch line the audience would eventually pick their own place to laugh essentially out of desperation martin periodically spoofed his philosophy studies in his 1970s standup act comparing philosophy with studying geology if youre studying geology which is all facts as soon as you get out of school you forget it all but philosophy you remember just enough to screw you up for the rest of your lifein 1967 martin transferred to ucla and switched his major to theater while attending college he appeared in an episode of the dating game winning a date with deana martin martin began working local clubs at night to mixed notices and at twentyone he dropped out of collegein 1967 his former girlfriend nina goldblatt a dancer on the smothers brothers comedy

comedy hour in 1968 he says appeared on the virginia graham show circa 1970 i looked grotesque i had a hairdo like a helmet which i blowdried to a puffy bouffant for reasons i no longer understand i wore a frock coat and a silk shirt and my delivery was mannered slow and selfaware i had absolutely no authority after reviewing the show i was depressed for a week during these years his roommates included gary mule deer and michael johnson gary mule deer supplied the first joke martin submitted to tommy smothers for use on the smothers brothers comedy hour show martin opened for groups such as

lets get small 1977 helped establish a national catch phrase his next album a wild and crazy guy 1978 was an even bigger success reaching the no 2 spot on the us sales chart selling over a million copies just a wild and crazy guy became another of martins known catchphrases the album featured a character based on a series of saturday night live sketches in which martin and dan aykroyd played

programdecades later in 2012 the av club described martins unique style and its effect on audiences both a consummate entertainer and a glib knowing parody of a consummate entertainer he was at once a hammy populist with an uncanny unprecedented feel for the tastes of a mass audience and a sly intellectual whose goofy shtick cunningly deconstructed standup comedyon his comedy albums martins standup is selfreferential and sometimes selfmocking it mixes philosophical riffs with sudden spurts of happy feet banjo playing with balloon depictions of concepts like venereal disease and the controversial kitten juggling he is a master juggler the kittens were stuffed animal toys his style is offkilter and ironic and sometimes pokes fun at standup comedy traditions such as martin opening his act from a wild and crazy guy by saying i think theres nothing better for a person to come up and do the same thing over and over for two weeks this is what i enjoy so im going to do the same thing over and over and over im going to do the same joke over and over in the same show itll be like a new thing or hello im steve martin and ill be out here in a minute in one comedy routine used on the comedy is not pretty album martin claimed that his real name was gern blanston the riff took on a life of its own there is a gern blanston website and for a time a rock band took the moniker as its namemartins show soon required fullsized stadiums for the audiences he was drawing concerned about his visibility in venues on such a scale martin began to wear a distinctive threepiece white suit that became a trademark for his act martin stopped doing standup comedy in 1981 to concentrate on movies and did not return for thirtyfive years about the decision he said my act was conceptual once the concept was stated and everybody understood it it was done it was about coming to the end of the road there was no way to live on in that persona i had to take that fabulous luck of not being remembered as that exclusively you know i didnt announce that i was stopping i just stoppedin 2016 martin made a lowkey comeback to live comedy opening for jerry seinfeld he performed a tenminute standup routine before
