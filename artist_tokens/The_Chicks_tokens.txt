active in the dallas and austin music scenes during this period the texan steel guitarist lloyd maines who had played on both albums introduced them to his daughter natalie an aspiring singer he thought his daughter would be a good replacement for macy and had passed her demo tape which had won her a scholarship to the berklee college of music to the erwin sisters her distinctive voice was a match for maguires soprano and strayers alto harmonies reviewing their show the birchmere virginia in 1992 eric brace of the washington post wrote that record label executives will be kicking themselves soon enough these chicks have what it takes to make the big time yet no major label has taken the plunge to sign themlynch became lead singer on the dixie chicks third crystal clear sound

offered to stay for the first recordings on the new album but the sisters thought it would send the wrong message to sony they all agreed she would leave before the new album in a 1996 interview lynch said it cant really be characterized as a resignation there are three dixie chicks and im only one in 2003 lynch said she had no regrets about leavingwith the addition of maines the new lineup had a more contemporary sound as well as a new look leaving their cowgirl dresses with their past giving the band a broader appeal renshaw sent staff producer blake chancey best known for his work with deryl dodd to austin to work with the bandafter maines joined the band the instrumental lineup was essentially the same though maines was not an acoustic bassist instead she played acoustic and electric guitar and occasionally electric bass guitar or tacoma papoose guitar in concert she sang lead vocals with maguire and strayer singing backing vocals strayer was now contributing to the bands sound adding guitar accordion sitar and papoose to her mastery of the fivestring banjo and dobro while maguire began adding guitar viola and mandolin chops more frequently to her expert fiddle the sisters welcomed the change maguire said its very rootsy but then natalie comes in with a rock and blues influence that gave emily and a chance to branch out because we loved those kinds of music but felt limited by our instrumentswithin the next year sony music nashville came to austin to see the revamped band and signed them as the first new artist on the newly revived monument records label their debut single i can love you better was released in october 1997 and reached the top 10 on billboard hot country songs while the new lineup recorded the rest of their debut album wide open spaces

accomplishments the band headlined their first tour the fly tour with guest artists including joe ely and ricky skaggs appearing at each show and also joined sarah mclachlan sheryl crow and other female artists on the allwoman touring lilith fair that november maguire divorced seidelthe source of the dixie chicks commercial success during this time came from various factors they wrote or cowrote about half of the songs on wide open spaces and fly their mixture of bluegrass mainstream country music blues and pop songs appealed to a wide spectrum of record buyers and where the women had once dressed as cowgirls with lynch their dress was now more contemporarycowboy take me away from fly became another signature song written by maguire to celebrate emilys marriage with country singer charlie robison which took place three months before the albums release however a few of their songs brought controversy within their conservative country music fan base and two songs caused some radio stations to remove the dixie chicks from their playlists sin wagon from which the term mattress dancing takes on a new twist and goodbye earl a song that uses black comedy in telling the story of the unabashed murderer of an abusive husband the band later made a video portraying the nefarious deed with actor dennis franz playing the murdered husband in an interview maines commented about sony worrying about the reference to mattress dancing in sin wagon refusing to discuss it in interviews she said our manager jokes you cant say mattress dancing but they love the song about premeditated first degree murder she continues so its funny to us that mattress dancing is out and murder is inafter the commercial success of their first two albums the band became involved in a dispute with their record label sony regarding accounting procedures alleging that in at least 30 cases sony had used fraudulent accounting practices underpaying them at least 4 million £27m in royalties on their albums over the previous three years sony held out and the trio walked away with sony suing the group for failure to complete their contract the dixie chicks responded with their own 41million lawsuit against sony music entertainment on august 27 which added clout to claims made by singers courtney love aimee mann and leann rimes against the recording industry after months of negotiation the dixie chicks settled their suit privately and were awarded their own record label imprint open wide records which afforded them more control a better contract and an increase in royalty payments with sony still responsible for marketing and distribution of albumsduring the time that they worked with sony to reconcile their differences the dixie chicks debuted their quiet unadorned song i believe in love on the america a tribute to heroes telethon following the september 11 attacks the three women found themselves home in texas each happily married planning families and writing songs closer to their roots without the usual pressures of the studio technicians from the major labels the songs they didnt write were solicited from songwriters who wrote with a less commercial emphasis the result was that home independently produced by lloyd maines and the dixie chicks was released august 27 2002unlike the dixie chicks two previous records home is dominated by uptempo bluegrass and pensive ballads and emmylou harris added her vocals to godspeed in addition the text of the opening track and first single long time gone was a pointed criticism of contemporary

singles chart and peaked at no 2 on the country chart becoming a major success approximately six million copies of home were sold in the united stateshome also won grammy awards and other noteworthy

of their upcoming album cowritten with dan wilson it addressed the political controversy that had surrounded the group for the previous three years strayer said the stakes were definitely higher on that song we knew it was special because it was so autobiographical and we had to get it right and once we had that song done it freed us up to do the rest of the album without that burden she said

lack of support from other country music performers a lot of artists cashed in on being against what we said or what we stood for because that was promoting their career which was a horrible thing to do a lot of pandering started going on and youd see soldiers and the american flag in every video it became a sickening display of ultrapatriotismmaines said the entire country may disagree with me but i dont understand the necessity for patriotism why do you have to be a patriot about what this land is our land why you can like where you live and like your life but as for loving the whole country i dont see why people care about patriotism the two singles were more successful in europe peaking at nos 13 and 11 respectively and remaining on the european country charts for more than 20
