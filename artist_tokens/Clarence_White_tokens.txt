international bluegrass music association hall of fame in 2016 and was inducted a second time in 2019 as a member of the kentucky colonelsclarence joseph leblanc was born on june 7 1944 in lewiston maine the leblanc family who later changed their surname to white were of frenchcanadian ancestry and hailed from new brunswick canada clarences father eric leblanc sr played guitar banjo fiddle and harmonica ensuring that his offspring grew up surrounded by music a child prodigy clarence began playing guitar at the age of six at such a young age he was barely able to hold the instrument and as a result he briefly switched to ukulele awaiting a time when his young hands would be big enough to confidently grapple with the guitarin 1954 when clarence was ten the white family relocated to burbank california and soon after clarence joined his brothers roland and eric jr who played mandolin and banjo respectively in a trio called three little country boys although they initially started out playing contemporary country music the group soon switched to a purely bluegrass repertoire as a result of rolands burgeoning interest in the genrein 1957 banjoist billy ray latham and dobro player leroy mack were added to the lineup with the band renaming themselves the country boys soon after in 1961 the country boys also added roger bush on double bass as a replacement for eric white jr that same year clarence and other members of the country boys appeared on two episodes of the andy griffith show between 1959 and 1962 the group released three singles on the sundown republic and briar international record labelsfollowing the recording sessions for the country boys debut album the band changed its name to the kentucky colonels in september 1962 at the suggestion of country guitarist and friend joe maphis the bands album was released by briar international under the title the new sound of bluegrass america in early 1963around this time clarences flatpicking guitar style was becoming a much more prominent part of the groups music after attending a performance by doc watson at the ash grove folk club in los angeles where he also met the guitarist clarence began to explore the possibilities of the acoustic guitars role in bluegrass music at that time the guitar was largely regarded as a rhythm instrument in bluegrass with only a few performers such as watson exploring its potential for soloing white soon began to integrate elements of watsons playing style—including the use of open strings and syncopation—into his own flatpicking guitar technique his breathtaking speed and virtuosity on the instrument was largely responsible for making the guitar a lead instrument within bluegrassthe kentucky colonels became well known on the bluegrass circuit during this period and made many live appearances throughout california and the united states between bookings with the colonels white also made a guest appearance on eric weissberg and marshall brickmans new dimensions in banjo bluegrass album which would be rereleased in 1973 as the soundtrack album to the film deliverance with weissberg and steve mandells version of dueling banjos added to the albums track listingin 1964 the colonels recruited fiddle player bobby sloan and continued to make live appearances at various clubs concert halls and festivals the colonels second album appalachian swing was a commercial success and saw whites flatpicking permanently expand the language of bluegrass guitar music critic thom owens has remarked that whites playing on the album helped pioneer a new style in bluegrass namely he redefined the acoustic guitar as a solo instrumentshortly after the recording of the appalachian swing album roland and clarence undertook some session work backing dobroist tut taylor on a dobrothemed album that was released by world pacific records in late 1964 as dobro country although the brothers were employed as session musicians the album was credited to tut taylor roland and clarence white upon releasealthough the colonels were a successful recording act it was becoming increasingly difficult for them to make a living due to the waning popularity of the american folk music revival due to the british invasion and homegrown folk rock acts such as the byrds and bob dylan as a result the colonels switched to electric instrumentation and hired a drummer in spite of these changes the kentucky colonels dissolved as a band following a show on october 31 1965 clarence roland and eric jr formed a new lineup of the colonels in 1966 with several other musicians but this second version of the group was shortlived and by early 1967 they had broken upduring 1964 white began to look beyond bluegrass music towards rock n roll as an avenue for artistic expression although he was influenced by country guitarists like doc watson don reno and joe maphis he also idolized the playing of jazz guitarist django reinhardt rock n roller chuck berry and studio musician james burton white even anticipated the viability of a folkrock hybrid when in the summer of 1964 he was approached by jim dickson to record a version of the thenunreleased bob dylan song mr tambourine man with electric instruments however despite whites enthusiasm for the project he was unable to convince his bandmates in the kentucky colonels of the experiments validity and ultimately the song was instead recorded by dicksons proteges the byrdsby the time the original lineup of the kentucky colonels folded in late 1965 white had become a respected and wellknown guitarist abandoning bluegrass temporarily he switched from his martin d28 acoustic guitar to an electric fender telecaster with the intention of becoming a studio musician like his hero james burton transitioning to electric guitar required white to modify his right hand playing technique switch from open chording to fretting the whole guitar neck with his left hand and practice using the tone and volume controls however he soon mastered the intricacies of the instrument and between 1965 and 1968 he undertook session work for artists including ricky nelson the monkees and the gosdin brothersas 1965 turned into 1966 white met gene parsons and gib guilbeau at a recording session for the gosdin brothers and shortly after he began to perform live with the duo in local california clubs as well as doing regular session work on their records which were released under the moniker of cajun gib and gene 1966 also saw white begin playing with a country group called trio which featured drummer bart haney and former kentucky colonel roger bush on bass in autumn of that year as a result of his friendship with gilbeau parsons and the gosdin brothers white was asked to provide lead guitar to exbyrd gene clarks debut solo album gene clark with the gosdin brothers white briefly joined clarks touring band shortly thereafterduring the clark album sessions white reconnected with mandolin player and bassist chris hillman who he had known during the early 1960s as a member of the bluegrass combo the hillmen hillman was currently a member of the byrds and in december 1966 he invited white to contribute countrified lead guitar playing to his songs time between and the girl with no name which both appeared on the byrds younger than yesterday album the countryoriented nature of the songs was something of a stylistic departure for the group and can be seen as an early indicator of the experimentation with country music that would color the byrds subsequent work white also contributed guitar to the bands followup album the notorious byrd brothers and to their seminal 1968 country rock release sweetheart of the rodeoby mid1967 white had begun performing at night in the band the reasons aka nashville west which included bass player wayne moore along with parsons and guilbeau as banjoistturneddrummer and lead singer respectively the band mostly worked at the nashville west club in el monte california frequently borrowing the clubs name as their own critic erik hage has said that in the years since their formation the band have become legendary as one of the first to play a seamless blend of country and rock although la group the international submarine band which featured country rock pioneer gram parsons no relation to gene were also exploring a similar sound concurrentlya live recording of nashville west would eventually be released in 1979 which music historian richie unterberger later described as being of considerable historical interest for anyone interested in the roots of countryrock unterberger also remarked that the recording illustrated nashville west as having more electric rock influences than most country acts were using at the time in addition to being a member of nashville west white was also a member of another country bar band that regularly played at the nashville west club called the roustaboutsin july 1967 white signed with gary paxtons bakersfield international record label and released a pair of solo singles tango for a sad mood bw tuff and stringy and grandma funderbunks music box bw riff raff he also reportedly recorded a solo album for the label although it has never been releasedduring 1967 while they were both members of nashville west white and parsons invented a device that enabled clarence to simulate the sound of a pedal steel guitar on his 1954 fender telecaster the need for such a device was driven by whites desire to bend his guitars bstring up a full tone while keeping his left hand on the strings and fretboard in order to achieve this feat white felt that he needed a third hand the guitarist turned to his friend parsons who was an amateur machinist and asked him to design and build an apparatus to pull or drop the bstringthe device which was known as the parsonswhite stringbender also known as the bbender was a springlever mechanism built into the inside of whites guitar which linked to the guitars strap button and the bstring when it was activated by pulling down on the guitar neck it pulled on the bstring and caused the guitar to simulate the crying sound of a pedal steel white would go on to use the device extensively as a member of the byrds and as a result the distinctive sound of the stringbender would become a defining characteristic of that bands music during whites tenure with the groupfollowing the abrupt departure from the byrds of singer and guitarist gram parsons in july 1968 white was invited to join the group as a fulltime member he remained until the band was finally dissolved by lead guitarist roger mcguinn in february 1973 this extended tenure with the band makes white the second longestserving member of the byrds after mcguinn white was brought into the group at bass player chris hillmans suggestion as someone who could handle the bands older rock material and their newer countryflavored repertoireonce he was a member of the byrds white began to express dissatisfaction with the bands current drummer kevin kelley before long he had persuaded mcguinn and hillman to replace kelley with his friend from the recently dissolved nashville west gene parsons no relation to gramhillman quit the byrds within a month of white joining in order to form the flying burrito brothers with gram parsons at around this same time white and gene parsons undertook some informal rehearsing and recording with hillman and gram parsons as part of a prototype version of the burrito brothers however the pair declined an invitation to join the new country rock group and instead opted to stay with mcguinns newlook byrdsthe greatest thing about clarence was that he never played anything that sounded vaguely weak he was always driving—into the music—and that pulled the whole band up he had that conservative thing he got from bluegrass where you underplay it on stage where everybody pokerfaces it he would do these truly outrageous things on guitar but hardly move a muscle aside from his hands—byrds leader roger mcguinn recalling whites onstage musicianship and demeanorthe whiteera version of the byrds featuring mcguinn white and parsons along with bassists john york september 1968–september 1969 and skip battin september 1969–february 1973 released five albums and toured relentlessly between 1969 and 1972 journalist steve leggett has noted that although the original lineup of the byrds gets the most attention and praise the latterday version—featuring mcguinn and whites dual lead guitar work—was regarded by critics and audiences as much more accomplished in concert than any previous configuration of the band had been similarly authors scott schinder and andy schwartz have commented that although the whiteera byrds failed to achieve the commercial success of the original lineup the group were a formidable live act and a consistently indemand attraction on the touring circuit the authors also cited the byrds archival release live at the fillmore – february 1969 as a good example of the whiteera bands musical potency rolling stone journalist david fricke has commented on whites contribution to the band by noting with his powerful impeccable tone and melodic ingenuity white did much to rebuild the creative reputation of the byrds and define the roadhearty sound of the group at the turn of the 70sthe first byrds album to feature white as a full member was dr byrds mr hyde which was released in early 1969 the album included a rerecording of the gene parsons and whitepenned instrumental nashville west as well as a rendition of the traditional song old blue which was the first byrds recording to utilize the stringbender the ballad of easy rider album followed in november 1969 on which white could be heard leading the band through a rendition of the traditional song oil in my lamp representing the guitarists first lead vocal performance as a byrd1970 saw the byrds release the double album untitled which consisted of one lp of live concert recordings and another of new studio recordings upon release the album was a critical and commercial success on both sides of the atlantic peaking at number

truck stop girl and a rendition of leadbellys take a whiff on me the latter also featured white playing mandolin in addition excerpts from an instrumental jam recorded during the untitled album sessions and logged in the columbia records files under the title of fifteen minute jam were later released as whites lightning and whites lightning pt2 on the byrds box set and the remastered double cd version of untitled respectivelythe 1971 byrdmaniax album saw white singing lead vocals on my destiny written by helen carter and jamaica say you will penned by the then littleknown songwriter jackson browne in addition white received a cowriting credit for the albums bluegrass instrumental green apple quick step this song also featured whites father eric white sr on harmonicafarther along released in november 1971 would prove to be the final album by the whiteera byrds it featured white singing the gospel hymn and title track farther along and a cover of the larry murray composition bugler this latter song features white playing mandolin and has been described by byrds expert tim connors as the best song on the album and by far the best vocal ever recorded by clarence white during his time with the byrdsfollowing the release of farther along the band continued to tour throughout 1972 but no new byrds album appeared in late 1972 the original fivepiece lineup of the byrds reunited and as a result mcguinn decided to disband the existing version of the band parsons had been fired in july 1972 and battin was dismissed by mcguinn in early 1973 the last concert by the whiteera version of the byrds which at this point featured former byrd chris hillman on bass and joe lala on drums was given on february 24 1973 at the capitol theatre passaic new jersey with white and mcguinn jokingly firing each other from the band afterwardsdespite being on tour or in the recording studio with the byrds for the majority of the time between 1969 and 1972 white continued to undertake selected session work for other recording artists during this period he played on joe cockers 1969 album joe cocker randy newmans 1970 album 12 songs and the everly brothers stories we could tell from 1972 in early 1971 white also contributed guitar to paul siebels jackknife gypsy album and the title track of the la getaway album by joel scotthill john barbata and chris ethridge other

party the night before and he and i had agreed to start working together again—not necessarily as the byrds but in some form he was incredibly talented and full of life and full of music i know hed still be doing something great today if he was still around—roger mcguinn recalling a meeting with white on the day before he diedin midfebruary 1973 just prior to the break up of the whiteera version of the byrds white joined with guitarist peter rowan mandolinist david grisman fiddler richard greene and banjoist bill keith to form the bluegrass supergroup muleskinner the musicians initially assembled as a oneoff pickup band to back bluegrass pioneer bill monroe for a television program but ended up performing on their own when monroes tour bus broke down on the way to the television studios a recording of this broadcast which was once thought lost was released as an album in 1992 under the title muleskinner live a vhs video cassette of the broadcast was also released in 1992 and later reissued on dvdas a result of the success of their appearance on the television broadcast the band was offered a one album recording contract with warner bros records sessions for the album took place at the record plant in los angeles between march 27 and april 14 1973 with richard greene and joe boyd producing the music the band recorded for the muleskinner album aka a potpourri of bluegrass jam was in the vein of country rock traditional bluegrass and progressive bluegrass or newgrass it was also one of the first bluegrass albums to feature a full drum kit the album was released in the latter half of 1973 and is nowadays regarded by critics as a milestone in the development of progressive bluegrass with exband members greene keith grisman and rowan all going on to become important figures in the development of that genrein addition to his work with muleskinner white also undertook a number of sessions between late 1972 and early 1973 for his friend gene parsons debut solo album kindling whites distinctive guitar and mandolin playing can be heard on the tracks do not disturb on the spot sonic bummer i must be a tree banjo dog back again and drunkards dream the latter of which also features white contributing harmony vocalsfollowing completion of the muleskinner album in april 1973 white reunited with his brothers roland and eric jr for a tour as the white brothers aka the new kentucky colonels after playing a handful of shows in california the white brothers departed for europe in may 1973returning to the us whites final bout of touring took place with the new kentucky colonels in june 1973 as part of a fourdate country rock package tour with gram parsons emmylou harris country gazette sneaky pete kleinow gene parsons byron berline and chris ethridge among others although gram and clarence had been acquainted with one another since the byrds sweetheart of the rodeo sessions the pair would develop a fast friendship during the minitour after a very acrimonious reacquaintance following the end of the package tour white entered the recording studio with producer jim dickson on june 28 and 29 1973 to begin work on a solo album he recorded a total of six songs four of which would belatedly be released on the archival album silver meteor a progressive country anthology in 1980white died on july 15 1973 after being struck by a drunk driver the accident occurred shortly after 2 am while he and his brother roland were loading equipment into their car in palmdale california following a white brothers concert gram parsons was especially shaken by his death he led a singalong of farther along at whites funeral service and later conceived his final song before his own death in my hour of darkness as a partial tribute to whiteclarence white helped popularize the acoustic guitar as a lead instrument in bluegrass music building on the work of guitarists such as doc watson prior to the advent of the more aggressive flatpicking style pioneered by guitarists like watson and white the guitar was strictly a rhythm instrument save for a few exceptions such as the occasional guitar track by banjoist don reno many of the most influential flatpickers of the 20th century cite white as a primary influence including dan crary norman blake and tony rice rice owned and played whites highly modified 1935 martin d28 david grier and russ barenberg are two other acoustic guitarists who were heavily influenced by whites guitar work whites bluegrass playing with the kentucky colonels was also a considerable influence on jerry garcia of the grateful dead who traveled with the band during 1964on the electric side of the guitar spectrum white was similarly influential together with fellow byrds bandmember gene parsons white invented the bbender device this device raises the bstring second string of the guitar a whole step by the use of pulleys and levers attached to both the upper strap knob and the second string on the guitar it is activated by pushing down on the neck and produces a pedal steel type sound arlen roth heavily influenced by this style did not at the time know that white and parsons had invented a bbender so instead developed his own unique allfinger bending version of this technique this was heavily documented in his groundbreaking book nashville guitar all of his recordings as well as his book masters of the telecaster subsequently his telecaster sound became as notable as his bluegrass playing marty stuart another guitarist influenced by whites playing now owns and regularly plays whites 1954 fender telecaster with the prototype bbendermusic archivist and writer alec palao has called white one of a handful of true greats amongst the instrumentalists of 20th century popular music before adding that the waves created by the guitarists idiosyncratic style are still forming ripples within bluegrass country and rock n roll in 2003 white was ranked no 41 on rolling stone magazines list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time in 2010 guitar manufacturer gibson ranked white at no 42 on their top 50 guitarists of all time listnotes
