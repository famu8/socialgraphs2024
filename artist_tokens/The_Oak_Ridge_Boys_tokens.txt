music hall of fame in 2015the core group that would eventually lead to the oak ridge boys was a country group called wally fowler and the georgia clodhoppers formed in 1943 in knoxville tennessee they were requested to perform for staff members and their families restricted during world war ii at the oak ridge national laboratory in nearby oak ridge tennessee they were asked to sing there so often that eventually they changed their name to the oak ridge quartet and because their most popular songs were gospel fowler decided to focus solely on southern gospel music at the time the quartet was made up of wally fowler lon deacon freeman curly kinsey and johnny new this group began recording in 1947 wally fowler and the oak ridge quartet were members of the grand ole opry in the 1940s in 1949 the other three men split from fowler to form a new group curley kinsey and the tennessee ridge runners so fowler hired an existing group the calvary quartet to reform the oak ridge quartet walt cornell sang baritone for the oak ridge quartet in the early 1950s in 1957 fowler sold the rights to the oak ridge quartet name to group member smitty gatlin in exchange for forgiveness of a debt as a result of more personnel changes the group lost its tenor so they lowered their arrangements and had gatlin sing tenor while the pianist tommy fairchild sang lead they recorded an album for cadence records then in 1958 they hired willie wynn to sing the tenor part and fairchild moved back exclusively to the piano at this point the group consisted of fairchild at the piano wynn gatlin singing lead baritone ron page and bass herman harper they recorded an album on the checker records label one on starday and three on skylite in 1961 gatlin changed the groups name to the oak ridge boys because their producer bud praeger thought oak ridge quartet sounded too oldfashioned for their contemporary soundin 1962 ron page left and the group hired gary mcspadden who had filled in for jake hess in the statesmen quartet as baritone with the understanding from jake hess that when he was ready to start a group he would recruit mcspadden they recorded another album on skylite and then two groundbreaking albums on warner bros records when hess followed through on that promise mcspadden quit to join a new group hess was forming the imperials jim hamill who later became a mainstay in the kingsmen quartet was chosen to be his replacement they made one album for festival records one for stateswood skylites budget label and two more for skylite hamill did not get along with the rest of the group and william lee golden a newcomer to the music industry felt that hamill was hurting the group and asked the group if he could be hammils replacement after hamills retirement from the group in 1964 golden joined as baritonethe group recorded another album for starday and another on skylite in 1965 in 1966 gatlin left the group to become a minister of music and on goldens recommendation duane allen formerly of the southernairs quartet and more recently baritone of the prophets quartet was hired to replace him with willie wynn still singing tenor and herman harper as bass the group made another album for skylite and one for united artists and then began recording on the heart warming label between 1966 and 1973 they made 12 albums with heart warming and the company also released

went from being one of the top acts on heart warming to nearly the bottom on columbia in terms of promotion columbia did not serve the gospel radio stations like heart warming did leaving the impression that the oak ridge boys were leaving gospel music which hurt the groups popularity among its core fan demographic while promoting the single heaven bound the oak ridge boys made appearances on the mike douglas show and the merv griffin show both nationally syndicated in the united states and canada in 1976 despite having been picked by paul simon to sing backup on slip slidin away the
