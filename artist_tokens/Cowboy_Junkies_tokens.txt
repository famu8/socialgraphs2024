vocalist the three timminses are siblings and anton worked with michael timmins during their first couple of bands john timmins was a member of the band but left the group before the recording of their debut studio album the band lineup has never changed since although they use several guest musicians on many of their studio albums including multiinstrumentalist jeff bird who has performed on every album except the firstcowboy junkies 1986 debut studio album produced by canadian producer peter moore was the bluesinspired whites off earth now recorded in the family garage using a single ambisonic microphonethe band gained wide recognition with their second studio album the trinity session 1988 recorded in 1987 at torontos church of the holy trinity their sound again with peter moore using the ambisonic microphone and their mix of blues country folk rock and jazz earned them both critical attention and a strong fan base the los angeles times named the recording one of the 10 best albums of 1988cowboy junkies have gone on to record 16 studio albums and five live albums with tour dates booked into 2024alan anton and michael timmins lifelong friends who met in kindergarten formed their first band in high school in 1979 influenced by postpunk bands such as siouxsie and the banshees and joy division they recruited drummer geoff railton and vocalist liza dawsonwhisker and formed hunger project in toronto they moved to manhattans lower east side and performed at a variety of clubs in early 1981 the hunger project embarked on a multicity tour of the united states after that hunger project moved to the united kingdom where they toured for three months and released the single the same insideassembly on their independent label latent recordingswhen hunger project disbanded alan anton and michael timmins remained in london and started an improvisational band named germinal the members – michael timmins on guitar alan anton on bass a drummer and saxophonist played whatever they wished on their instruments at the same time germinal released two studio albums germinal 1 1983 and din 1984 the music newspaper new musical express said germinal ranks among the most innovative and aggressive sounds to emerge from the independent scene this year alan anton and michael timmins had a somewhat different take saying it was the ultimate release for us but for the audience it was quite a chore in london they developed journeyman skills as musicians and expanded their knowledge of music history — michael timmins worked in a record store for a year to make ends meet while with germinal among those who were to influence michael timmins and alan anton were jazz musicians cecil taylor ornette coleman john coltrane along with the sound of early blues musicians lightnin hopkins john lee hooker bukka white and robert johnson germinal broke up after three years in autumn of 1984 alan anton moved to berlin and michael timmins returned to new york cityupon their return to toronto in 1985 alan anton and michael timmins rented a house insulated the tiny garage and with younger brother pete timmins sitting in on drums began exploring a new musical direction margo was drafted to join and recalls i was contemplating going on to graduate school staying in school that was safe i never wanted to be a musician or be onstage nevertheless michael timmins began to hear something in what they were doing with their initial jams realizing that a female voice was what the band needed michael timmins said i thought if you had this female voice on top of it you could do anything you wantedhowever the slow musical tempos and whispery hushed tones that defined their early work was not just musical inspiration but came about by necessity their recording studio was their repurposed garage which was just behind the house and bordered closely with their neighbours on their first jam session the police showed up due to a noise complaint from the neighbour according to michael timmins we realized we had to tone down one thing fed into the other margo began to realize that her singing voice was more effective quiet we began to realize if we can get down underneath margo the sound will be more effective pete picked up brushes – he was just learning to play drums at that point everything sort of came down we learned to play with less volumewhen the unnamed band was preparing for its first gig the members considered various names before choosing cowboy junkies during their early gigs the band would perform at the rivoli which had a small space in the back the group would perform a rhythmic groove while margo sang improvised vocal melodies and portions of old blues songs many times the junkies entire performance would be a single jam sessionpeter moore a recording enthusiast who had ambitions of becoming a producer was at their first show according to moore i was mesmerized by margo the very first show people werent paying attention to them because they were playing so softly and quietly margo had her back to the audience a lot of the timewhen the cowboy junkies were ready to record a studio album the band sought a likeminded recording engineer they met peter moore at a dinner party and when they began talking about recording equipment and techniques they found that moores interest in singlemicrophone recording meshed with their desire to capture the intimate sound of their rehearsal garage moore had just purchased a calrec ambisonic microphone at the wholesale price of 9000 the cowboy junkies and moore came together at the rehearsal space on june 26 1986 and turned the garage into a recording studio moore arranged the group around his calrec juryrigged a control room in the kitchen and started recordingthe cowboy junkies shopped their material but were unable to find a label to distribute their work so they revived the indie label latent recordings that michael timmins and anton had used for their hunger project and germinal works and released whites off earth now in october 1986 they sold 3000 copies the band then toured the us michael timmins described the experience while touring whites we had spent a lot of time in the southern states especially virginia georgia and the carolinas for some reason the club owners down there took a liking to what we were doing so we spent a lot of time crossing the kudzu choked highways that ran through the heart of the old confederacy those were the days when having to spend a night in a hotel room would mean the difference between eating the next day or paying for the gas to get us to the next town so we spent a lot of our time sleeping on the floors of friendly promoters fans waitresses and bartendersthe bands next project the trinity session 1988 became their breakthrough peter moore again produced the album they approached the project as a reaction against the midi–dominated musical styles of the 80s moore said i was angry that music had gotten into drum machines and midi no humanity no nothing im listening to these recordings from the 50s with two or three mics and im going man thats real music he chose the church of the holy trinity in toronto for its natural reverb to better persuade the officials of the historic church moore claimed the timmins family singers were recording a christmas special the session began early on november 27 1987 songs with the fewest instruments were recorded first and then the songs with gradually more complex arrangements in this way moore was able to solve acoustic problems one by one to better balance margos vocals against the electric guitars and drums she was recorded through a pa system left behind by a previous group by making subtle changes in volume and placement relative to the microphone over six hours moore and the band finally reached the distinctive sound of the albummusic critic for rolling stone magazine anthony decurtis summed up the result of the groups efforts in a fourstar review of the album the trinity session is in the great tradition of albums that establish a mood and sustain it so consistently that the entire record seems like one continuously unfolding song the mood in this instance is hypnotic and introspective – an intense melancholic longing that blends the elemental emotions of country music and the blues with the poetic worldweariness of the velvet underground having good songs the skill to convey what they have to say and most important a vision the cowboy junkies dispensed with hightech trumpery and made their record simply and seriously that attitude helped make the album as important as it is inspiringthe album was included in the book 1001 albums you must hear before you diethe bands third studio album was more challenging requiring three attempts to get the sound the band desired yet despite the problems with the making of it the band considers it a very exciting and turbulent time in their career and state that the caution horses 1990 remains one of their favourite albums the band rented a small recording studio in the docklands of toronto with the intention of using the room like the garage their debut studio album was recorded in instead of a room with live acoustics like the church room they used for the trinity session 1988 the session went badly because the group had just come off the road after a gruelling tour and were tired particularly margo timmins who had a terrible head cold after a few hours they realized the session wasnt working out and they leftthe second attempt was made on april 21 of 1987 when peter moore rented the sharon temple an historic landmark located in the village of sharon ontario michael timmins recalls the arrangements that we had developed for this new set of songs were at times so full and lush unlike the spareness of most of trinitys songs that we were immediately confronted with the problem of how to control this swirl of sound so that it didnt just turn to mush on tape another problem was that the temple was a lot more acoustically lively than any of us had imagined as a result when the music swelled it would often spill over into margos vocal mic and feedback at the end of three days during which the temperature would drop below freezing michael timmins states when we packed up and left sharon that day i dont think that any of us felt that we had captured anything special it had been a difficult three days and i think that we were all just happy that on that third day we had at least made some decent recordings of the songs if not necessarily memorable ones over the next several months the band were touring and playing songs on the sharon tape as the band listened new ideas for them evolved they also wrote additional songs although the band truly loved the recordings the songs continued to develop on stage and they believed the session no longer accurately represented where they were as a band in 2022 however they released the sharon session as a special edition vinyl album as well as in streaming formatsat the end of the tour they decided to go into eastern studios in downtown toronto and reinvent how they recorded themselves the caution horses sessions went quickly and smoothly and were recorded over several days in december 1989 michael timmins believes the beauty of the recording and one of the reasons it remains one of our favourites is that it captures the essence of the band which magically fell together during the recording of the trinity session and which forged its own voice under the glare of a very intense spotlight in the clubs and concert halls of the worldwith their next studio album black eyed man 1992 michael timmins wanted to explore music structure specifically time shifts and tempo shifts while margo timmins wanted to expand her singing style and her range several musicians from previous albums showed up during the rehearsal sessions along with about twenty five other toronto players that were known to the band or recruited because of their skills with instruments the band wanted to include in the album realizing he needed a theme to hold the album together what michael timmins decided upon was love found love lost and love betrayed it was to be the journey of the faceless nameless and haunted black eyed manthe bands fifth studio album pale sun crescent moon 1993 is a song cycle about malefemale relationships margo timmins describes the theme of the album as there is love and there is all that conspires to steal love away michael timmins says it is a very dense and complex work both lyrically and musically music critic mike boehm summed the album up this way by the albums end margo timmins the singer known for her preternatural hush can be heard declaring herself with assertive bite its a expletive ole world but this ole girl well she aint giving in while it hasnt exactly turned into a hardrock band the closely drawn highly literate moodconscious internal monologue remains the signature of the bands style those aggressive opening and closing moments do signal a desire to avoid being typecast as that whispering band that found success by recording in an echoing churchthe cowboy junkies sixth studio album lay it down 1996 was one in which the group wanted to make the music outside of toronto and away from usual routines so they searched for a place that was a comfortable drive away from toronto but would feel remote alan anton recalls we found rock island named not for music but for geology it is actually one big rock with stuff growing on it and has one small house with a great stone fireplace we went there for a week at a time and between chopping wood cooking boating whittling hiking and staring into the fire worked up some songs that were as laid back and sparse as the setting when the junkies went to record the songs they felt that their chosen songs would come together if they could find a studio which would approximate the vibe of rock island in the sense of a relaxed but focused mood and its remoteness from the music industry mainland they found a bigporched southern house in athens georgia that fit their needs the junkies moved into the rented home in the suburbs of athens in june 1995 the producer and engineer john keane had built a homey but stateoftheart studio and the band settled in quicklythe cowboy junkies last studio album of the decade is an alternative country album miles from our home 1998 wanting to repeat the process of writing and creating used for lay it down michael timmins found a house near a gristmill on a pond a couple hours drive from toronto where he spent six months writing songs during that time margo and peter timmins and alan anton would come down to work on songs then michael wrote more until the songs were worked out and ready to record on new years day in 1997 just as timmins was planning the album the band heard that townes van zandt had died van zandt was a friend of the band had toured with them in their bus in 1990 and was perhaps the biggest influence as a songwriter on michael on the day that michael timmins had heard that van zandt had died he wrote the first draft of blue guitar as a tribute to the man who had the bluest guitar that i had ever heardthroughout their career cowboy junkies have approached each studio album to see where they can change or improve open which was released on may 15 2001 follows in that tradition while they were on a tour to support their live album waltz across america which lasted nine months and had many breaks in the schedule they began working on new material they added two to three new songs a month into their performances allowing the songs to evolve on stage during breaks they would go to sound engineer daryl smiths studio chemical sound to live record material they had created being able to set up in a couple hours record some tracks and be done by the end of the day was a departure from their habit of trying to complete an albums worth of songs in a set recording period on each visit they would record two or three songs they also took the opportunity to rerecord songs after the band had recorded fifteen tracks they listened and decided they had the songs they needed with two additional songs recorded at peter moores home studioone soul now 2004 was recorded over the course of a year from october 2002 to october 2003 its central idea is that everyone is interconnected when the band returned home after their open tour they decided to turn their rehearsal area into a recording studio which they dubbed the clubhouse this new arrangement changed the process of how they created their tracks previously they would start in the rehearsal space determine how the songs would work then go to a studio now the band recorded everything as they worked through the rehearsal processthe cowboy junkies next project was early 21st century blues which was recorded february through march 2005 and released in august of that year it was begun a few months after their previous tour the theme for the album was war violence fear greed ignorance or loss and everybody had to bring two or three songs written by other people this album was unique in that john timmins recorded with his siblings playing guitarat the end of paths taken was released on april 9 2007 michael timmins wrote songs that reflect the complex frustrating edifying and conflictridden web of relationships that constitute the family from nuclear to extended to global he is a parent and a son with aging parents he plays with his siblings in the cowboy junkies timmins blends his alternative country music sound with ferocious guitar work on my little basquiat and mountain at times timmins sounds as if he has lost control of his guitar playing until you realize theres not a stray note to be found timmons guitar playing has grown more aggressive over the yearsfor the twentieth anniversary of their breakthrough studio album the trinity session 1988 the cowboy junkies reinterpreted the album to highlight what twenty years of performing experience brought to the songs in order to expand upon the goal of reinterpreting the cowboy junkies invited three guest musicians whose work has affected the cowboy junkies and whose work and lives were affected by the album guest musicians on the 2007 album include natalie merchant vic chesnutt and ryan adams each does lead vocal on one of the albums songs merchant on to love is to bury chesnutt on postcard blues and adams on 200 more miles they also perform on other tracks jeff bird a session musician who has appeared on virtually every cowboy junkies album is also included in the project in order to create the same atmosphere they kept rehearsal to a minimum getting together for a few hours a day before the recording the guest musicians worked with the band to reimagine the songs making suggestions trying out fresh nuances the album contains a performance film trinity revisited and a documentary film trinity session revisited directors pierre and françois lamoureux produced and recorded the album and the films although the album was not recorded with a single microphone like the original album the directors placed the musicians in a circle and used a surround microphone augmented the recording with ten closemics to record themthe nomad series 2017 is a set of four studio albums that was released over three years from 2010 to 2012 the nomad series is not based on a particular theme regarding music but are based on a set of paintings by their friend artist enrique martinez celaya the group found the name appropriate since they have been touring for over 30 years the junkies had no recording contract when they created the nomad series which freed them up to be experimental with their music to avoid categorizing the planned releasesthe first album in the series is renmin park 2010 which is based on ideas the bands principal songwriter michael timmins got while living in china for three months with his wife and three children two of his children were adopted from china and during their stay they visited the birth village of his adopted daughters most of their time was spent in jingjiang situated on the yangtze river about two hours drive from shanghai the music that inspired timmins most during the visit was found at renmin park where a variety of musicians would gather throughout the day bringing their erhus pipas shangxians various percussion instruments and a mix of singers performed timmins found most of the musicians outstanding he thought the singers were good because they all performed with passion about halfway through the visit timmins was introduced to eric chen who was passionate about music and became timmins friend chen brought timmins a variety of cds and videos that showcased the chinese rock scenemichael asked his brother peter timmins to send him a highend portable recorder which he carried everywhere he went and recorded music conversations exercise classes badminton games traffic students chatter in classrooms street hawkers and more he sent the recordings to joby baker in british columbia with instructions to create loops of the sounds and to use his imagination the core of the album is built around a fictional love story between two people who live in different worlds that always keep them apart renmin park is also a thankyou letter to the people of the city that so kindly welcomed him and his familyon december 25 2009 at the age of 45 cowboy junkies friend vic chesnutt died from an overdose of muscle relaxants chesnutt was generally a friendly and cheerful man but he sometimes suffered bouts of severe depression demons released january 18 2011 is the cowboy junkies tribute to him the band had included him in their twentieth anniversary celebration of the trinity session when they made trinity revisited 2007 chesnutt sang lead vocals on the song postcard blues he had also toured with the group several times starting with the tour supporting lay it down 1996 michael timmins stated one of the hopes of this album is that it inspires people to seek out the originals and keep his music alive we had intended to do an album where he would write the songs and we would be the band now were trying to fulfil a bit of that desire the cowboy junkies managed to turn an album born from grief into an assertion of lifeon october 14 2011 music critic jason lent began his review of sing in my meadow with this observation when rem called it quits the band talked about walking away having maintained their artistic integrity throughout a 30year career as cowboy junkies pass the quarter century mark the toronto band must rest well at night the bands consistent work flies under the radar more times than not and the band sounds content with keeping it that way he continues one of the bands live staples in recent years is hunted from 1994s pale sun crescent moon revisiting the song here the original sounds frail and timid in comparison margo belts out the lyrics with the dry bitterness of someone who has witnessed firsthand the arrows that fly between men and women as the band shakes the rafters bird delivers a mandolin solo that redefines the possibilities of the instrumentthe wilderness was released on march 27 2012 and is the fourth and final entry of the nomad series the album reflects the introspective nature of winter the album is a return to the folk vibe the band played with in the late 80s and early 90s songwriter michael timmins states i started to think in terms of an album of songs reflecting on the lives of characters id written about early in the bands career and bringing those characters into the future to see where their lives were at now about his lyrics timmins says some of those songs have little touch points where you can see how they connect to earlier songs even characters names and stuff pops into them and thats intentional the style of the songs on the album comes closer to the typical cowboy junkies music more than the other albums in the nomad seriesthe cowboy junkies studio album all that reckoning was released on july 13 2018 in an interview about the upcoming album with billboard guitarist and songwriter michael timmins said theres a lot of pressures and a lot of crumbling of institutions very little foundation to put ones feet on again especially at an older age you sort of expect things to be there and realize my god

whirlwind of attention that was created by the release of the trinity session 1988 and the subsequent release of the caution horses 1990 we had accumulated literally trunks full of press clippings
