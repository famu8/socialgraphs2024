orbison 1913–1984 and nadine vesta shults 1914–1992 orbie was an oilfield driller who struggled to find work after the great depression and nadine enjoyed painting and writing poetry p2 orbison ’ s direct paternal ancestry was traced to thomas orbison born 1715 from lurgan northern ireland who settled in the province of pennsylvania in the middle of the century according to the authorized roy orbison a biography written by roys son alex the family moved to fort worth in 1942 to find work in the aircraft factories due to eyesight problems roy wore thick glasses from the age of four p3 orbisons father gave him a guitar on his sixth birthday and roy was taught how to play it by his father and older brother roy recalled i was finished you know for anything else by the time he was 7 and music became the focus of his life his major musical influence as a youth was country and western swing music he was particularly moved by lefty frizzells singing with its slurred syllables leading orbison to adopt the stage name lefty wilbury during his time with the traveling wilburys he also enjoyed hank williams bob wills moon mullican and jimmie rodgers one of the first musicians that he heard in person was ernest tubb playing on the back of a truck in fort worth orbison also said that a formative experience was the regular singing sessions at fort worth where he was surrounded by soldiers who were intensely emotional because they were about to be sent to the front line in world war ii in west texas he was exposed to rhythm and blues western swing texmex the orchestral arrangements of mantovani and cajun music the cajun favorite jole blon was one of the first songs that he sang in public he began singing on a local radio show at age 8 and he became the shows host by the late 1940s p89 at the age of 9 orbison won a contest on radio station kvwc which led to his own radio show where he sang the same songs every week he attended denver avenue elementary school in fort worth until a polio scare in 1944 prompted his parents to send roy then aged 8 and his brother grady lee to vernon to live with their grandmother p8 as world war ii wound down roys parents returned to vernon p3 the orbison family moved again in 1946 to wink texas in search of employment orbison described life in wink as football oil fields oil grease and sand and expressed relief that he was able to leave the desolate town roy was selfconscious about his appearance and began dyeing his nearlywhite hair black when he was still young he was quiet selfeffacing and remarkably polite and obliging during recess at school he played guitar by himself while the other kids were playing physical games p14 as a teenager roys lack of sporting ability left him with shyness and low selfesteem p16 roy was always keen to sing however and considered his voice memorable but not greatin 1949 orbison then 13 years old formed the band wink westerners with school friends billy pat ellis on drums slob evans on bass fiddle richard west on piano and james morrow on electric mandolin p16 they played country and western swing standards and glenn miller jazz swing songs at local honkytonk bars and had a weekly morning radio show on kerb in kermit texas their first performance was at a school assembly in 1953 they were offered 400 to play at a dance and orbison realized that he could make a living in music p23 orbison was also part of a marching band and singing octet at the age of 15 orbison decided that instead of becoming a guitar player he would use the guitar as an accompaniment to his singing p26 in 1953 the wink westerners entered a talent contest on kmidtv in midland texas the group won the contest resulting in a 30minute spot on a local television show p27 after the show orbison asked the owner of the company sponsoring the show if he could sponsor the group for ongoing shows which led to the wink westerners playing weekly shows on kmidtv on friday nights and on odessa television station kosatv on saturday nights p28 it was around this time that orbison began dyeing his hair naturally a dishwater grey color to jet black p28 after graduating from high school in 1954 orbison enrolled at north texas state college in denton his plan was to study geology so that he could secure work in the oil fields if music did not pay however he became bored with the course in its first year and switched to history and english but orbison preferred to play music with fellow students billy pat ellis dick penner and wade moore p2930 penner and moore had written a simple catchy rockabilly song called ooby dooby which impressed orbison and he started looking into how he could make a recording of it p30 orbison continued performing with the wink westerners after his first year he then heard that his schoolmate pat boone had signed a record deal and it further strengthened his resolve to become a professional musician p30 at a new years eve dance in 1954 the wink westerners had mostly played country and western swing music throughout the night but ended the night by playing bill haley the comets ’ hit song shake rattle and roll repeatedly which became the catalyst for the band switching to rock and roll music p31 also orbison had seen elvis presley perform back during his days at north texas state college in 1954 and was impressed by the shocking gyrations that elvis exhibited on stageat the end of the spring semester of 1955 orbison dropped out of north texas state college switching to odessa junior college p32 the wink westerners were disbanded in the fall of 1955 and orbison formed a new band called the teen kings the band was made of orbison billy pat ellis and james morrow from the wink westerners plus jack kennelly on bass and johnny wilson p32 it was at a dance event where the teen kings performed that orbison met his future wife claudette frady p30 claudette was fourteen at the time five years younger than orbison p40 the teen kingss first recording was the song ooby dooby which was recorded at norman pettys studio in clovis new mexico in march 1956 it was published by odessabased startup label je–wel as the bside of the jewel 101 single p36 the aside of the single was tryin to get to you a song previously recorded by elvis presley p36 after ooby dooby was published by jewel records orbison became convinced that a larger record company would be able to sell more copies of the record and he spoke to a lawyer about breaking the contract with jewel p40 initially orbison obtained an injunction to prevent jewel from distributing the record before they reached an agreement that the band would pay back the label the costs of producing the records p40 orbison was now free to find a new label to market ooby dooby however a further setback was that he cut a demo of the song for columbia records which they turned down but had one of their contract artists sid king release a recording of ooby dooby before orbison could offer the tape to another record company p40 eventually sun records would sign up to record ooby dooby but the events that led to this are disputed p42 some claim that johnny cash toured the odessa area in 1955 and 1956 appearing on the same local tv show as the wink westerners cash stated that in late 55 or early 56 i was touring with elvis when i met roy in texas i told him to get in touch with sun records if he wanted to be a recording artist orbison has said that when he did this sam phillips the owner of sun records told him johnny cash doesnt run my record company p42 however both sam philips and billy pat ellis the bands drummer have disputed that johnny cash was involved p4243 three of the teen kings band members have said that their relationship with sun records began when odessa record store owner poppa holifield played it over the telephone for sam phillips in april 1956 and phillips offered the teen kings a contract p42 the teen kings went to sun studio in memphis in order to rerecord ooby dooby for publication by sun records p42 after an audition of the song sam phillips signed the band up for a year or two p47 however the bands career soon slumped since orbison wanted to record emotional ballads rather than the rockabilly songs demanded by sam phillips and phillipss goal for a successor to elvis presley had moved on from orbison to carl perkins p51 the teen kings were granted a reprieve when carl perkins was badly injured in a car crash resulting in ooby dooby being released along with go go go as sun single 242 in may 1956 p51 the teen kings began an experimental tour of drivein theaters in the southern us states playing on top of projection house roofs between drivein film showings with sonny james johnny horton carl perkins and johnny cash much influenced by elvis presley orbison performed frenetically doing everything we could to get applause because we had only one hit record orbison also began writing songs in a rockabilly style including go go go and rockhouse in june 1956 ooby dooby peaked at number 59 in the billboard charts and sold 200000 copies however the followup singles didnt reach the chartsthe teen kings played alongside carl perkins johnny cash warren smith and eddie bond at the overton park shell on june 1 1956 but orbisons relationship with the rest of the band was deteriorating at this stage p53 elvis presley was in the audience for this show and orbison claimed that elvis praised orbison but another band member says that it was actually jack kennelly the bands bass player that presley praised p53 kennelly said that roys dream was to be a star and once sam phillips inflated his ego he couldnt be a part of a unit roy became egomaniacal p53 in the summer of 1956 orbison purchased a brandnew purple cadillac and a diamond ring with his first royalty cheque from ooby dooby p53 however the band soon found out that their pay cheques from the concerts were not covering their costs and that life as a touring band was a demoralizing experience p55 the bands contract didnt include any royalty payments bmi when their songs were played on the radio and orbison had run out of money by late 1956 p58 orbison was encouraged by norman petty to record a single without the teen kings and the rest of the band walked on roy during a recording session when told of a plan to rename the band roy orbison and the teen kings p56 the band broke up in december 1956 and sam phillips said they were arguing about money but the basic problem was that orbison was too much of a loner and driven egoist p61 the lack of a band was a serious problem for orbisons contract at sun records since the label had no use for a singer who didnt have a band p61 after the teen kings split orbison stayed in memphis with his girlfriend claudette they stayed in phillips home and phillips stated that they didnt sleep together in his house p63 however orbison was broke and realized that he couldnt survive as a recording artist so after several weeks he returned to the road he toured with johnny cash sonny burgess eddie cochran and gene vincent playing mostly songs from other artists before finishing the set with a song of his own p64 at the time orbison was addicted to sleeping pills and speed p67 orbison was introduced to elvis presleys social circle and at some stage picked up a date for presley in his purple cadillac p53 in august 1957 orbison returned to the sun recording studio and recorded several new songs with just his acoustic guitar instead of a backing band p68 however none were successful and roy gave up on becoming a recording artist p68 sam phillips remembered being much more impressed with orbisons mastery of the guitar than with his voice p6061 orbison returned to odessa texas in the fall of 1957 to be together with his sixteenyearold girlfriend claudette p69 the two began to talk about getting married on a professional level orbison met singer joe melson while in memphis who would collaborate with orbison on his biggest hit songs in the early 1960s p70 a ballad orbison wrote the clown met with a lukewarm response after hearing it sun records producer jack clement told orbison that he would never make it as a ballad singer nonetheless he continued to pitch his ballad claudette which he began working on in early 1956 to singers he met on tour p68 and in april 1958 the everly brothers recorded it as the bside of their hit all i have to do is dream p76 claudette reached number 30 in the charts in march 1959 orbison then left sun records due to a dispute about royalties from the song claudette which was recorded by nashville records p72 orbison and claudette had married in 1957 and their first child was born on september 16 1958 p76 using the royalty payments from the everly brothers hit claudette orbison bought the most expensive new pink cadillac available p76 however roy and claudette spent the money lavishly and were soon broke and living with roys parents in wink p78 increasingly frustrated at sun he gradually stopped recording he toured music circuits around texas and then quit performing for seven months in 1958during the period of 1958–1959 orbison made his living at acuffrose music a songwriting firm concentrating mainly on country music after spending an entire day writing a song he would make several demonstration tapes at a time and send them to wesley rose who would try to find musical acts to record them orbison then worked with and was in awe of chet atkins who had played guitar with presley and attempted to sell his recordings of songs by other writers to the rca victor record label one of these songs was seems to me by boudleaux bryant bryants impression of orbison was of a timid shy kid who seemed to be rather befuddled by the whole music scene i remember the way he sang then—softly prettily but almost bashfully as if someone might be disturbed by his efforts and reprimand himplaying shows at night and living with his wife and young child in a tiny apartment orbison often took his guitar to his car to write songs the songwriter joe melson an acquaintance of orbisons tapped on his car window one day in texas in 1958 and the two decided to write some songs together in three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959 orbison recorded seven songs for rca victor at their nashville studios only two singles paper boy and with the bug p86 were judged worthy of release by the label wesley rose brought orbison to the attention of the producer fred foster at monument records the record label that orbison would soon switch toin his first session for monument in nashville orbison recorded a song that rca victor had refused paper boy it was accompanied by the bside sing with the bug but neither song chartedorbisons own style the sound created at rca victor studio b in nashville with pioneer engineer bill porter the production by foster and the accompanying musicians gave orbisons music a polished professional sound finally allowing orbisons stylistic inclinations free rein orbison requested to use string instruments instead of fiddles which was unusual for the time p87 he recorded three new songs the most notable of which was uptown written with joe melson and released in late 1959 impressed with the results melson later recalled we stood in the studio listening to the playbacks and thought it was the most beautiful sound in the world the rolling stone illustrated history of rock and roll states that the music orbison made in nashville brought a new splendour to rock and compared the melodramatic effects of the orchestral accompaniment to the musical productions of phil spectoruptown was a modest hit and the first song by orbison and melson to reach the billboard top 100 p89 his initial success came just as the 1950s rockandroll era was winding down starting in 1960 the charts in the united states came to be dominated by teen idols novelty acts and motown girl groupsexperimenting with a new sound orbison and joe melson wrote a song in early 1960 which using elements from uptown and another song they had written called come back to me my love employed strings and the anita kerr doowop backing singers it also featured a note hit by orbison in falsetto that showcased a powerful voice which according to biographer clayson came not from his throat but deeper within the song was only the lonely know the way i feel orbison was passing through memphis when he tried to pitch the song to elvis presley along with several other songs in order to make some money quickly but it was early in the morning and presley did not want to see orbison at that time p91 orbison and melson instead recorded the song at rca victors nashville studio with sound engineer bill porter trying a completely new strategy building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up beginning with closemiked backing vocals in the foreground and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background this combination became orbisons trademark soundonly the lonely shot to number two on the billboard hot 100 and hit number one in the uk and australia according to orbison the subsequent songs he wrote with melson during this period were constructed with his voice in mind specifically to showcase its range and power he told rolling stone in 1988 i liked the sound of i liked making it sing making the voice ring and i just kept doing it and i think that somewhere between the time of ooby dooby and only the lonely it kind of turned into a good voice but at the time of its recording orbison was struggling to earn a living because he was only working as a singer at local dances p94 also the days of his working with melson were numbered due to disagreements such as who came up with the title for only the lonely p95 the success of only the lonely transformed orbison into an overnight star and he appeared on dick clarks saturday night beechnut show out of new york city when presley heard only the lonely for the first time he bought a box of copies to pass to his friends p98 soon after recording an early version of his next hit blue angel orbison and his wife and son roy dewayne born in 1958 moved from wink to the suburb of hendersonville in nashville p94 orbisons second son anthony king would follow in 1962 melson also moved to hendersonville soon after and began working on blue angel together which was recorded in august 1960 p102 this hit was a more complex song yet it still peaked at number nine in the usa p102 the followup single im hurtin with i cant stop loving you as the bside rose to number 27 in the us but failed to chart in the uk after the success of blue angel orbison undertook a hectic touring schedule often performing with his neighbor patsy cline p103 during this time claudette was lonely and unhappy and some people said that orbison was unfaithful to her while he was on tour p104 back in the studio seeking a change from the pop sound of only the lonely blue angel and im hurtin orbison worked on a new song running scared about a man worried that his girlfriend is about to leave him for another man p106 orbison encountered difficulty when he found himself unable to hit the songs highest note without his voice breaking he was backed by an orchestra in the studio and porter told him he would have to sing louder than his accompaniment because the orchestra was unable to be softer than his voice fred foster then put orbison in the corner of the studio and surrounded him with coat racks forming an improvised isolation booth to emphasize his voice orbison was unhappy with the first two takes in the third however he abandoned the idea of using falsetto and sang the final high a naturally so astonishing everyone present that the accompanying musicians stopped playing on that third take running scared was completed fred foster later recalled he did it and everybody looked around in amazement nobody had heard anything like it before just weeks later running scared became orbisons first number one hit on the billboard hot 100 chart and it reached number 9 in the uk the composition of orbisons following hits reflected running scared a story about an emotionally vulnerable man facing loss or grief with a crescendo culminating in a surprise climax that employed orbisons dynamic voicethe bside crying followed soon after and reached the top 5 singles in august 1961 p107 crying was coupled with an uptempo rb song candy man written by fred neil and beverley ross which reached the billboard top 30 staying on the charts for two months by the end of 1961 orbison had recorded six hit singles in a row over the past two years p107 while orbison was touring australia in 1962 an australian dj referred to him affectionately as the big o partly based on the big finishes to his dramatic ballads and the moniker stuck with him thereafter orbisons second son was born the same year and orbison hit number four in the united states and number two in the uk with dream baby how long must i dream an upbeat song by country songwriter cindy walker orbison enlisted the webbs from dothan alabama as his backing band the band changed their names to the candy men in reference to roys hit and played with orbison from 1962 to 1967 they later went on to have their own career releasing a few singles and two albums on their own also in 1962 he charted with the crowd leah and workin for the man which he wrote about working one summer in the oil fields near wink p32 orbisons relationship with joe melson however was deteriorating over melsons growing concerns that his own solo career would never get off the groundorbison first met bob dylan at dylans 21st birthday party in may 1962 p112 from 1959–1963 orbison was the top selling american artist and one of the world ’ s biggest namesorbison eventually developed an image that did not reflect his personality he had no publicist in the early 1960s and therefore had little presence in fan magazines and his single sleeves did not feature his picture life called him an anonymous celebrity after leaving his thick eyeglasses on an airplane in 1963 orbison was forced to wear his prescription faosa sunglasses on stage p109 and found that he preferred them the sunglasses led some people to assume he was blind his black clothes and song lyrics emphasized the image of mystery and introversion p108 orbison later recalled that he wasnt trying to be weird i didnt have a manager who told me to dress or how to present myself or anything but the image developed of a man of mystery and a quiet man in black somewhat of a recluse although i never was reallyorbisons string of top40 hits continued with in dreams us number 7 in january 1963 p114 uk number 6 falling us number 22 uk number 9 and mean woman blues us number 5 uk number 3 coupled with blue bayou us number 29 uk number 3 according to the discography in the authorized roy orbison a rare alternative version of blue bayou was released in italy orbison finished 1963 with a christmas song written by willie nelson pretty paper us number 15 in 1963 uk number six in 1964as in dreams was released in april 1963 orbison was asked to replace duane eddy on a tour of the uk in top billing with the beatles the tour sold out in one afternoon when orbison arrived in britain however he realized he was no longer the main draw he had never heard of the beatles and annoyed asked rhetorically whats a beatle anyway to which john lennon replied after tapping his shoulder i am p115 on the opening night orbison opted to go onstage first although he was the more established act the beatles stood dumbfounded backstage as orbison simply played through 14 encores finally when the audience began chanting we want roy again lennon and paul mccartney physically held orbison back p117 ringo starr later said in glasgow we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting he was just standing there not moving or anything through the tour however the two acts quickly learned to get along a process made easier by the fact that the beatles admired his work orbison felt a kinship with lennon but it was george harrison with whom he would later form a strong friendshipin 1963 touring took a toll on orbisons personal life after discovering a letter from one of orbisons secret girlfriends his wife claudette had an affair with the builder of their home in tennessee p120 billy pat ellis said claudette had the affair because roy was gone a lot and she got lonely and wanted to prove she was attractive again p120 when orbison toured britain again in the autumn of 1963 she joined him p1223 later in 1963 orbison toured england ireland and canada p122 in 1964 he toured australia and new zealand with the beach boys and returned again to britain and ireland where he was so besieged by teenaged girls that the irish police had to halt his performances to pull the girls off him p125 he traveled to australia again in 1965 this time with the rolling stones mick jagger later remarked referring to a snapshot he took of orbison in new zealand a fine figure of a man in the hot springs he was p134 orbison also began collaborating with bill dees whom he had known in texas with dees he wrote its over a numberone hit in the uk and orbisons most successful song p126 when claudette walked in the room where dees and orbison were writing to say she was heading for nashville orbison asked if she had any money dees said a pretty woman never needs any money p127 just 40 minutes later oh pretty woman was completed a riffladen masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a bob hope movie the epithet mercy orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note it rose to number one in the autumn of 1964 in the united states and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks it rose to number one in the uk as well spending a total of 18 weeks on the charts the single sold over seven million copies orbisons success was greater in britain as billboard magazine noted in a 68week period that began on august 8 1963 roy orbison was the only american artist to have a numberone single in britain he did it twice with its over on june 25 1964 and oh pretty woman on october 8 1964 the latter song also went to number one in america making orbison impervious to the current chart dominance of british artists on both sides of the atlantic p128 by late 1964 orbison had occasionally treated himself to a groupie p130 and his wife claudette had had an affair with the builder braxton dixon who had built orbisons house p121 after roy became aware of the affair he fired dixon and finished building the house himself with the help of a hired carpenter p132 in early 1965 roy confirmed that he and claudette were divorced p132 later in 1965 claudette gave birth to roys third child and roy and claudette reunited several months later p143 orbisons singles in early 1965 had been unsuccessful and his contract with monument was expiring soon p137 wesley rose at this time acting as orbisons agent moved him from monument records to mgm records though in europe he remained with deccas london records for 1 million and with the understanding that he would expand into television and films as elvis presley had done orbison was a film enthusiast and when not touring writing or recording he dedicated time to seeing up to three films a day the move was described as orbison joining the ranks of fading rock stars fleeing to mgm p137 rose also became orbisons producer fred foster later suggested that roses takeover was responsible for the commercial failure of orbisons work at mgm engineer bill porter agreed that orbisons best work could only be achieved with rca victors ateam in nashville orbisons first collection at mgm an album titled there is only one roy orbison sold fewer than 200000 copies with the onset of the british invasion in 1964–65 the direction of popular music shifted dramatically and most performers of orbisons generation orbison was 28 in 1964 were driven from the charts the contractual requirement to release a certain amount of singles and albums per year for mgm also took its toll on the quality of orbisons songsorbison was fascinated with machines he was known to follow a car that he liked and make the driver an offer on the spot p126 while on tour again in the uk in 1966 orbison broke his foot falling off a motorcycle in front of thousands of screaming fans at a race track he performed his show that evening in a cast claudette traveled to britain to accompany roy for the remainder of the tour it was now made public that the couple had happily remarried and were back together they had remarried in december 1965roy and claudette shared a love for motorcycles after roy had been introduced to them by elvis presley p54 orbison was a daredevil driver blasting around on his harleydavidson motorcycle and owning a ferrari car which he used to challenge other drivers to race him on the highway p1 on june 6 1966 when orbison and claudette were both riding their motorcycles home from bristol tennessee she was struck by a pickup truck in gallatin tennessee and thrown into the air she was taken by ambulance to hospital but her liver was seriously injured and she died aged 25 p148 a grieving orbison threw himself into his work collaborating with bill dees to write music for the fastest guitar alive a film that mgm had scheduled for him to star in as well it was initially planned as a dramatic western but was rewritten as a comedy orbisons character was a spy who stole and had to protect and deliver a cache of gold to the confederate army during the american civil war and was supplied with a guitar that turned into a rifle the prop allowed him to deliver the line i could kill you with this and play your funeral march at the same time with according to biographer colin escott zero conviction orbison was pleased with the film although it proved to be a critical and boxoffice failure while mgm had included five films in his contract no more were made p1513 he recorded an album dedicated to the songs of don gibson and another of hank williams covers but both sold poorly p153 during the counterculture era with the charts dominated by artists like jimi hendrix jefferson airplane the rolling stones and the doors orbison lost mainstream appeal yet seemed confident that this would return later saying didnt hear a lot i could relate to so i kind of stood there like a tree where the winds blow and the seasons change and youre still there and you bloom again orbisons single cry softly lonely one from march 1967 was his last song to enter the top 100 until the 1980sduring a tour of britain and playing birmingham on saturday september 14 1968 he received the news that his home in hendersonville tennessee had burned down and his two eldest sons had died this occurred two years after the death of his wife claudette and orbisons grief meant he couldnt write songs fire officials stated that the cause of the fire may have been an aerosol can which possibly contained lacquer the property was sold to johnny cash whose house at the same location also burned down laterduring the 1968 tour of england orbison and his childhood friend bobby blackburn slept with many girls over the course of two months and used a calendar on the wall to track when each girl was arriving and leaving their rented apartment in upper brook street in london p156 during this time orbison met the sixteen yearold german girl barbara wellhonen with whom he became fascinated p156 although orbison continued to see other girls in the meantime p157 on may 25 1969 orbison and wellhonen got married p163 roy was 33 years old at the time and sources vary regarding whether wellhonen was either 17 18 or 19 p163 wesley born 1965 his youngest son with claudette was raised by orbisons parents orbison and wellhonen had a son roy kelton in 1970 and another alexander in 1975orbison continued recording albums in the 1970s but his career went nowhere during this decade p169 in 1974 he switched record labels from mgm to mercury records for a onealbum deal p170 although the peak of his success was over

the film blue velvet 1986 p191 although lynch has stated to the contrary that he and his producers obtained permission to use the song without speaking to orbison in the first place lynchs first choice for a song had actually been crying the song served as one of several obsessions of a psychopathic character named frank booth played by dennis hopper it was lipsynched by ben dean stockwell

protagonist during filming lynch would also sit his cast down every few hours and ask them to listen to the song p193 orbison was initially shocked at its use he saw the film in a theater in malibu and later said i was mortified because they were talking about the candycolored clown in relation to a dope deal i thought what in the world but later when i was touring we got the video out and i really got to appreciate what david gave to the song and what the song gave to the movie—how it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to in dreams the use of orbisons

coolest uncool loser youd ever seen with his cokebottle black glasses his threeoctave range he seemed to take joy sticking his knife deep into the hot belly of your teenage insecurities—bruce springsteen 2012 sxsw keynote addressrock and roll in the 1950s was defined by a driving backbeat heavy guitars and lyrical themes that glorified youthful rebellion few of orbisons recordings have these characteristics the structure and themes of his songs defied convention and his muchpraised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians although he never mentioned any classical music influences peter lehman summarized it writing he achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth orbison was known as the caruso of rock p97 and the big oroys boys llc a nashvillebased company founded by orbisons sons to administer their fathers catalog and safeguard his legacy announced a november 16 2018 release of unchained melodies roy orbison with the royal philharmonic orchestra album as well as an autumn 2018 roy orbison hologram tour called in dreams roy orbison in concertmusic critic dave marsh wrote that orbisons compositions define a world unto themselves more completely than any other body of work in pop music orbisons music like the man himself has been described as timeless diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric within a hairs breadth of being weird peter watrous writing for the new york times declared in a concert review he has perfected an odd vision of popular music one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformityin the 1960s orbison refused to splice edits of songs together and insisted on recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers together the only convention orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs otherwise each seems to follow a separate structure using the standard 32bar form for verses and choruses normal pop songs followed the versechorusversechorusbridgeversechorus structure where a represents the verse b represents the chorus and c the bridge most pop songs can be represented by ababcab like ooby dooby and claudette orbisons in dreams was a song in seven movements that can be represented as introabcdef no sections are repeated in running scared however the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax to be represented as aaaab crying is more complex changing parts toward the end to be represented as abcdefabcdef although orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before only the lonely he claimed never to have learned how to write themim sure we had to study composition or something like that at school and theyd say this is the way you do it and thats the way i would have done it so being blessed again with not knowing what was wrong or what was right i went on my own way so the structure sometimes has the chorus at the end of the song and sometimes there is no chorus it just goes but thats always after the fact—as im writing it all sounds natural and in sequence to me elton johns songwriting partner and main lyricist bernie taupin wrote that orbisons songs always made radical left turns and kd lang declared that good songwriting comes from being constantly surprised such as how the entirety of running scared eventually depends on the final note one word some of the musicians who worked with orbison were confounded by what he asked them to do the nashville session guitarist jerry kennedy stated roy went against the grain the first time youd hear something it wouldnt sound right but after a few playbacks it would start to grow on you p128 critic dave marsh categorizes orbisons ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss and dreaming a third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as go go go and mean woman blues that are more thematically simple addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine braggadocio in concert orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grimin 1990 colin escott wrote an introduction to orbisons biography published in a cd box set orbison was the master of compression working the singles era he could relate a short story or establish a mood in under three minutes if you think thats easy—try it his greatest recordings were quite simply perfect not a word or note surplus to intention after attending a show in 1988 peter watrous of the new york times wrote that orbisons songs are dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set pieces music critic ken emerson writes that the apocalyptic romanticism in orbisons music was wellcrafted for the films in which his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was so overthetop that dreams become delusions and selfpity paranoia striking a postmodern nerve led zeppelin singer robert plant favored american rb music as a youth but beyond the black musicians he named elvis and orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience the poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning used drama to great effect and he wrote dramaticallythe loneliness in orbisons songs that he became most famous for he both explained and downplayed i dont think ive been any more lonely than anyone else although if you grow up in west texas there are a lot of ways to be lonely his music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture robin gibb of the bee gees stated he made emotion fashionable that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things for men to sing about very emotional things before that no one would do it orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular when came out i dont think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to crywhat separates orbison from so many other multioctavespanning power singers is that he can hit the biggest notes imaginable and still sound unspeakably sad at the same time all his vocal gymnastics were just a means to a powerful end not a mission unto themselves roy orbison didnt just sing beautifully—he sang brokenheartedly—stephen thompson nprorbison admitted that he did not think his voice was put to appropriate use until only the lonely in 1960 when it was able in his words to allow its flowering carl perkins however toured with orbison while they were both signed with sun records and recalled a specific concert when orbison covered the nelson eddy and jeanette macdonald standard indian love call and had the audience completely silenced in awe when compared to the everly brothers who often used the same session musicians orbison is credited with a passionate intensity that according to the rolling stone illustrated history of rock and roll made his love his life and indeed the whole world to be coming to an end—not with a whimper but an agonised beautiful bangbruce springsteen and billy joel both commented on the otherworldly quality of orbisons voice dwight yoakam stated that orbisons voice sounded like the cry of an angel falling backward through an open window barry gibb of the bee gees went further to say that when he heard crying for the first time that was it to me that was the voice of god elvis presley stated orbisons voice was the greatest and most distinctive he had ever heard p175 193 orbisons music and voice have been compared to opera by bob dylan tom waits and songwriter will jennings among others dylan marked orbison as a specific influence remarking that there was nothing like him on radio in the early 1960swith roy you didnt know if you were listening to mariachi or opera he kept you on your toes with him it was all about fat and blood he sounded like he was singing from an olympian mountaintop he was now singing his compositions in three or four octaves that made you want to drive your car over a cliff he sang like a professional criminal his voice could jar a corpse always leave you muttering to yourself something like man i dont believe it likewise tim goodwin who conducted the orchestra that backed orbison in bulgaria had been told that orbisons voice would be a singular experience to hear when orbison started with crying and hit the high notes goodwin stated the strings were playing and the band had built up and sure enough the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up it was an incredible physical sensation p184 bassist jerry scheff who backed orbison in his a black and white night concert wrote about him roy orbison was like an opera singer his voice melted out of his mouth into the stratosphere and back he never seemed like he was trying to sing he just did ithis voice ranged from baritone to tenor and music scholars have suggested that he had a three or fouroctave rangeorbisons severe stage fright was particularly noticeable in the 1970s and early 1980s during the first few songs in a concert the vibrato in his voice was almost uncontrollable but afterward it became stronger and more dependable this also happened with age orbison noticed that he was unable to control the tremor in the late afternoon and evenings and chose to record in the mornings when it was possibleorbison often excused his motionless performances by saying that his songs did not allow instrumental sections so he could move or dance on stage although songs like mean woman blues did offer that he was aware of his unique performance style even in the early 1960s when he commented im not a super personality—on stage or off i mean you could put workers like chubby checker or bobby rydell in secondrate shows and theyd still shine through but not me id have to be prepared people come to hear my music my songs thats what i have to give themkd lang compared orbison to a tree with passive but solid beauty this image of orbison as immovable was so associated with him it was parodied by john belushi on saturday night live as belushi dressed as orbison falls over while singing oh pretty woman and continues to play as his bandmates set him upright again however lang quantified this style by saying its so hard to explain what roys energy was like because he would fill a room with his energy and presence but not say a word being that he was so grounded and so strong and so gentle and quiet he was just thereorbison attributed his own passion during his performances to the period when he grew up in fort worth while the us was mobilizing for world war ii his parents worked in a defense plant his father brought out a guitar in the evenings playing the driving rhythm of western swing and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military gathered to drink and sing heartily with him orbison later reflected i guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me because its still there that sense of do it for all its worth and do it now and do it good not to analyze it too much but i think the verve and gusto that everybody felt and portrayed around me has stayed with me all this time p7 studio
