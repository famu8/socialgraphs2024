stay in los angeles guthrie moved to portland oregon in the neighborhood of lents on the promise of a job gunther von fritsch was directing a documentary about the bonneville power administrations construction of the grand coulee dam on the columbia river and needed a narrator alan lomax had recommended guthrie to narrate the film and sing songs onscreen the original project was expected to take 12 months but as filmmakers became worried about casting such a political figure they minimized guthries role the department of the interior hired him for one month to write songs about the columbia river and the construction of the federal dams for the documentarys soundtrack guthrie toured the columbia river and the pacific northwest guthrie said he couldnt believe it its a paradise which appeared to inspire him creatively in one month guthrie wrote 26 songs including three of his most famous roll on columbia roll on pastures of plenty and grand coulee dam the surviving songs were released as columbia river songs the film columbia was not completed until 1949 see below at the conclusion of the month in oregon and washington guthrie wanted to return to new york tired of the continual uprooting mary guthrie told him to go without her and the children although guthrie would see mary again once on a tour through los angeles with the almanac singers it was essentially the end of their marriage divorce was difficult since mary was a catholic but she reluctantly agreed in december 1943following the conclusion of his work in the northwest guthrie corresponded with pete seeger about seegers newly formed folkprotest group the almanac singers guthrie returned to new york with plans to tour the country as a member of the group the singers originally worked out of a loft in new york city hosting regular concerts called hootenannies a word pete and woody had picked up in their crosscountry travels the singers eventually outgrew the space and moved into the cooperative almanac house in greenwich villageinitially guthrie helped write and sing what the almanac singers termed peace songs while the nazi–soviet pact was in effect after hitlers invasion of the soviet union the group wrote antifascist songs the members of the almanac singers and residents of the almanac house were a loosely defined group of musicians though the core members included guthrie pete seeger millard lampell and lee hays in keeping with common utopian ideals meals chores and rent at the almanac house were shared the sunday hootenannies were good opportunities to collect donation money for rent songs written in the almanac house had shared songwriting credits among all the members although in the case of union maid members would later state that guthrie wrote the song ensuring that his children would receive residualsin the almanac house guthrie added authenticity to their work since he was a real working class oklahoman there was the heart of america personified in woody and for a new york left that was primarily jewish first or second generation american and was desperately trying to get americanized i think a figure like woody was of great great importance a friend of the group irwin silber would say woody routinely emphasized his workingclass image rejected songs he felt were not in the country blues vein he was familiar with and rarely contributed to household chores house member agnes sis cunningham another okie would later recall that woody loved people to think of him as a real working class person and not an intellectual guthrie contributed songwriting and authenticity in much the same capacity for pete seegers postalmanac singers project peoples songs a newsletter and booking organization for labor singers founded in 1945guthrie was a prolific writer penning thousands of pages of unpublished poems and prose many written while living in new york city after a recording session with alan lomax lomax suggested guthrie write an autobiography lomax thought guthries descriptions of growing up were some of the best accounts he had read of american childhood during this time guthrie met marjorie mazia the professional name of marjorie greenblatt a dancer in new york who would become his second wife mazia was an instructor at the martha graham dance school where she was assisting sophie maslow with her piece folksay based on the folklore and poetry collected by carl sandburg folksay included the adaptation of some of guthries dust bowl ballads for the dance guthrie continued to write songs and began work on his autobiography the end product bound for glory was completed with editing assistance by mazia and was first published by ep dutton in 1943 it is told in the artists downhome dialect the library journal complained about the too careful reproduction of illiterate speech however clifton fadiman reviewing the book in the new yorker remarked that someday people are going to wake up to the fact that woody guthrie and the ten thousand songs that leap and tumble off the strings of his music box are a national possession like yellowstone and yosemite and part of the best stuff this country has to show the worldthis book was the inspiration for the movie bound for glory starring david carradine which won the 1976 academy award for original music score for original song score and its adaptation or adaptation score and the national board of review award for best actor among other accoladesin 1944 guthrie met moses moe asch of folkways records for whom he first recorded this land is your land

a song that makes you think that you are not any good i hate a song that makes you think that you are just born to lose bound to lose no good to nobody no good for nothing because you are too old or too young or too fat or too slim too ugly or too this or too that songs that run you down or poke fun at you on account of your bad luck or hard travelingi am out to fight those songs to my very last breath of air and my last drop of blood i am out to sing songs that will prove to you that this is your world and that if its hit you pretty hard and knocked you for a dozen loops no matter what color

controversial scholar ronald radosh has writtenis friends gordon friesen and sis cunningham the founders in the 1960s of broadside and former members of the almanac singers told me in a 1970s interview that woody was a member of the same cp club as they were and was regularly given a stack of the daily worker which he had to sell on the streets each daysimilarly writer and historian aaron j leonard in an article detailing guthries party membership for the history news network quoted pete seegeron the other hand sis cunningham who was a much more disciplined person than either me or woody was in a greenwich village branch of the party she got woody in she probably said ill see woody acts responsibly and so woody was briefly in the communist partyleonard in his book the folk singers and the bureau also documents how the fbi treated guthrie as if he were a member adding him to various iterations of their security index – and keeping him on it till well into the early 1960safter the molotov–ribbentrop pact guthrie took an antiwar uturn and wrote one song describing the soviet invasion of poland as a favor to polish farmers and another attacking president roosevelts
