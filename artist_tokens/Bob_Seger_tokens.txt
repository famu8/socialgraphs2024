single backed with east side sound an instrumental version of east side story sold 50000 copies mostly in the detroit area and led to a contract with cameoparkway records though the name the last heard originally referred to the collection of omens and town criers who recorded east side story with seger it soon became the name of segers permanent band which consisted of former town crier pep perrine on drums carl lagassa on guitar and dan honaker on bass following east side story the group released four more singles the james browninspired holiday single sock it to me santa the dylanesque persecution smith vagrant winter and perhaps the most notable heavy music released in 1967 heavy music which sold even more copies than east side story had the potential to break out nationally when cameoparkway suddenly went out of business it was a top 100 hit in canada where it topped out on the national rpm charts at no 82 in the us it just missed the hot 100 peaking on the bubbling under chart at no 103 the song would stay in segers live act for many years to comeafter cameoparkway folded seger and punch began searching for a new label in the spring of 1968 bob seger the last heard signed with major label capitol records turning down motown records who offered more money than capitol seger felt that capitol was more appropriate for his genre than motowncapitol changed the name of the band to the bob seger system in the transition between labels guitarist carl lagassa left the band and keyboard player bob schultz joined the systems first single with capitol was the antiwar message song 2 2 which reflected a marked change in segers political attitudes from the ballad of the yellow beret the single was again a hit in detroit and hit number 1 on radio stations in buffalo new york and orlando florida but went unnoticed almost everywhere else and failed to chart nationally in the us the single did however make the canadian national charts peaking at no 79the second single from the bob seger system was ramblin gamblin man it was a major hit in michigan and it also became segers first national hit peaking at no 17 the songs success led to the release of an album

manseger was unable to follow up on this success for the next album singersongwriter tom neme joined the system ultimately writing and singing the majority of the tunes featured for which the group

final album 1970s mongrel this time without neme bob schultz left the band as well being replaced by dan watson mongrel with the powerful single lucifer was considered to be a strong album by many

success of ramblin gamblin man 1969 the system dissipated for a short period following the breakup seger had ambitions to be a oneman act in 1971 he released his first solo album the allacoustic brand new morning the album was a commercial failure and led to his departure from capitol recordsseger having regained an eye for bands began playing with the duo teegarden van winkle who in 1970 had a hit single with god love and rock roll together they recorded smokin ops 1972 released on punch andrews own palladium records the album mainly consisted of covers spawning a minor hit with a version of tim hardins if i were a carpenter no 76 the us though it did feature someday a new seger original and a rerelease of heavy music the album reached 180 on the billboard 200after spending most of 1972

version of segers later live classic turn the page rosalie a song seger wrote about cklw music director rosalie trombley and which was later recorded by thin lizzy and ive been working a song
