sans farrar including bassist john stirratt drummer ken coomer and multiinstrumentalist max johnston he even enlisted uncle tupelo guest guitarist brian henneman of the bottle rockets to perform who appears on many of the tracks for wilcos debut album am the group considered retaining the uncle tupelo name but decided to call themselves wilco after the military and commercial aviation radio voice abbreviation for will comply a choice which tweedy has said is fairly ironic for a rock band to name themselvesafter collaborating with syd straw on a cover version of the ernest tubb song the tb is whipping me released in september 1994 on the red hot country compilation produced by the red hot organization wilco began recording tracks for am their first studio album at easley studio in june 1994 a demo tape from the recordings was sent to executives at reprise records a subsidiary of warner brothers and the label signed tweedy to a contract although tweedy said that he wanted a more collaborative project than uncle tupelo only his name appeared on the reprise contract tweedy requested songwriting submissions from other members but only one submission—john stirratts its just that simple—appeared on am it was the last song wilco ever released that was lyrically solely written by a member besides tweedystylistically similar to uncle tupelo the music on am was considered to be straightforward alternative country rock in what tweedy later described as trying to tread some water with a perceived audience am peaked at number twentyseven on the billboard heatseekers chart considerably lower than the debut album of jay farrars new band son volt the album was met with modest reviews though it would rank thirtyfourth in the village voices 1995 pazz jop critics poll critically and commercially paling in comparison to the reception of son volts album the wilco members perceived am to be a failure shortly after the release of the album multiinstrumentalist jay bennett joined the band providing the band with a keyboardist and another guitaristwilco made its live debut on november 17 1994 to a capacity crowd at ciceros basement bar in st louis missouri the band was billed for the occasion as black shampoo during the two hundreddate tour supporting am tweedy began to write songs for a second album the lyrical theme of the songs reflected a relationship between musical artist and a listener tweedy chose this topic because he sought to eschew the alternative country fan base ken coomer elaboratedthe whole no depression thing was funny to us because people seemed to forget that jeff was a bigger punkrock fan than a country fan it led to things like us all switching instruments on misunderstood where im playing guitarwilco recorded a number of songs with this theme including sunken treasure and hotel arizona wilco also recorded a number of songs in the style of am wilco named the album being there after a peter sellers film of the same name the band went through some personnel changes during the recording sessions max johnston left the band because he felt that his role in the band had diminished in favor of bennett he had also been replaced by violinist jesse greene on one track because the band felt that johnston was unable to play the part bob egan of freakwater briefly joined the band in the studio playing pedal steel guitar on far far away and dreamer in my dreams and then became an official member in september 1996unlike the am recording sessions the band had no desire to produce a hit song from their second effort the recording sessions produced nineteen songs too many for a single album release tweedy was concerned about the high retail price that a double album would be sold for at least 30 so he asked reprise records to release it as a double album at a single album price 1798 or less reprise agreed to this on the terms that they received wilcos share of the album royalties it was estimated in 2003 that the band lost almost 600000 on the deal but tweedy was satisfied being there was well received by critics from several major media outlets including rolling stone the album reached no 73 on the billboard album charts a significant improvement from am and placed fourteenth on the pazz jop critics poll for 1996 the albums single outtasite outta mind became the groups first song to enter the billboard charts reaching no 39 on the modern rock tracks chart and no 22 on the mainstream rock tracks chartin november 1997 wilco entered willie nelsons recording studio in spicewood texas to record a third studio album the album was lyrically inspired by the marital problems of tweedy and his wife as well as by twentiethcentury literature tweedy relied heavily on bennett to provide music for the singers bold but depressing lyrics wilco recorded several songs including via chicago and shes a jar but began working on another project before assembling the tracks into an albumnora guthrie contacted singersongwriter billy bragg in spring 1995 about recording some unreleased songs by her father folk singer woody guthrie most of the songs were written late in guthries life when he was unable to record due to the motor impairments of huntingtons disease by the 1990s woody guthrie had become a relic to the mtv generation and nora sought to establish a different legacy for the musician to nora bragg was the only singer i knew taking on the same issues as woody bragg was concerned however that his fans would not realize that the songs were written by guthrie when he performed them on tour so he decided to record the album with another bandbragg contacted tweedy and bennett about corecording the album while wilco was on the european segment of their being there tour bragg was particularly fond of being there because their influences extended farther back than the 1950s although tweedy was indifferent to the offer bennett was enthused about recording songs with one of his idols—bennetts previous band titanic love affair was named after a billy bragg lyric a recording contract between bragg and wilco was signed after a show at shepherds bush empire bragg mostly recorded the politically charged lyrics while tweedy preferred to record lyrics that showcased guthrie as a freak weirdo the recording of mermaid avenue began on december 12 1997 and was the topic of bbcs man in the sand documentary filmtempers flared between bragg and wilco after the album was completed bennett believed that bragg was overproducing his songs a sharp contrast to wilcos sparser contributions bennett called bragg about the possibility of remixing braggs songs to which bragg responded you make your record and ill make mine eventually bragg sent copies of his recordings to chicago for bennett to remix but bragg refused to use the new mixes on the album the two parties were unable to establish a promotional tour and quarreled over royalties and guest musician feesdespite these conflicts the album was released on june 23 1998 and sold over 277000 copies the album received rave reviews from robert christgau and rolling stone and was nominated for a grammy award for best contemporary folk album it also placed fourth on the pazz jop critics poll for 1998 after the album was released bob egan was replaced by multiinstrumentalist leroy bachafter the completion of the mermaid avenue sessions wilco returned to spicewood to complete their third studio album summerteeth unlike previous wilco and uncle tupelo recordings the album featured a lot of overdubbing with pro tools stirratt and coomer were concerned with the production since it reduced their involvement in the music according to stirrattthe story of summerteeth is jay bought a mellotron and he was going to use it no matter what it was lovely but it was overdone once they got going on the overdubs they didnt stop and nobody in the band stepped up to stop the madness it reminds me of heart of darkness where you knowingly extend the creative process for the purpose of exploration or redemption or whatever it is youre looking forduring 1999 warner brothers was looking to help repay a 16 billion debt acquired during the recent merger of parent company warner communications with time inc as a result warners imprints were under pressure to produce musical acts that would yield hit records the head of reprise howie klein who had previously authorized the release of being there as a double album was willing to let wilco produce summerteeth without label input when klein played the album for reprises ar department however they demanded a radio single for the album wilco agreed to do this once and once only and recorded a radiofriendly version of cant stand it at the request of david kahne the head of the ar department the single version of cant stand it failed to cross over from triplea radio to alternative rock stations the album sold only 200000 copies significantly less than being there despite critical acclaim the album placed eighth on the pazz jop critics poll for 1999after the release of summerteeth the band resumed the mermaid avenue sessions although they had recorded enough material for a second release in 1998 wilco recorded a few new songs for mermaid avenue vol ii someday some morning sometime featuring a vibraphone filtered through a space echo was identified by tweedy as being the piece to the puzzle towards the creation of their fourth studio album the album was released on may 30 2000 and was the last release from the sessions the remainder of the sessions were released in 2012 as mermaid avenue vol iii also part of mermaid avenue the complete sessionsshortly after the recording sessions for mermaid avenue vol ii wilco purchased a studio on irving park road in chicago which they named the wilco loft the band recorded tracks in the studio in early 2000 for a fourth studio album in may 2000 jeff tweedy requested to perform with jim orourke at a festival in chicago tweedy was a fan of orourkes bad timing orourke introduced tweedy to drummer glenn kotche and the trio enjoyed working together so much that they decided to record an album as a side project named loose fur wilco had recorded an entire album of music at this point but tweedy was unhappy with the drum parts he enjoyed kotches contributions to loose fur so much that tweedy brought him into the studio to rerecord some demos some believe that tweedy sought to make wilco sound like loose fur after officially replacing ken coomer with kotche in january 2001although bennett sought to be the mixer and engineer for yankee hotel foxtrot tweedy was unsure of bennetts abilities compared to orourke tweedy and bennett frequently argued over whether the album should be accessible to a general listener or attempt to cover new musical ground unbeknownst to bennett tweedy invited orourke to remix i am trying to break your heart and the results impressed the other band members—even bennett tensions grew between bennett and orourke because bennett wanted to mix every song on the album orourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs some songs such as poor places only featured the loose fur trio the album was completed in 2001 and bennett was dismissed from the band immediately afterwards the recording of the album was documented by sam jones and released in 2002 as the film i am trying to break your heart a film about wilcotime warner which owned warner bros records merged with america online in 2001 leading to more pressure on warners record labels to cut costs over 600 employees of warner music group were fired including howie klein the president of reprise recordsdavid kahne became the interim head of reprise kahne assigned mio vukovic to monitor the progress of yankee hotel foxtrot and to offer suggestions music journalist greg kot claims that vukovic disliked the album and was unhappy that wilco ignored his suggestions he brought the album to kahne who felt that there was no single on the album in june 2001 the album was rejected by reprise and wilco was asked to leave the labelwilco managed to negotiate a buyout from reprise music journalist greg kot claims that instead of financial compensation the band agreed to leave the label with the master tapes of yankee hotel foxtrot the label was already receiving bad publicity for its treatment of the band and were willing to accommodate wilcos request however allmusic claims warnerreprise agreed to sell them the masters for a reported 50000 after wilco was unwilling to change the album to make it more commercially viable in a lastminute decision the label freed wilco from their contract and gave them the album at no charge curbing the negative publicity warner music group began to invest more in bands including the flaming lips lead singer wayne coyne remarkedwe are benefiting from the labels regret over wilco we are living in the golden age of that being such a public mistake the people on warners said well never have a band like wilco feel we dont believe in them again theyd tell me that it would never happen to us and what a great day for meas the band searched for a new label to release the album they decided to stream it on their official website to discourage illegal trading of lowquality mp3s the band signed with nonesuch records another time warner subsidiary and the album was released in the spring of 2002 when it was released yankee hotel foxtrot reached number thirteen on the billboard 200 wilcos

side project loose fur unlike summerteeth and yankee hotel foxtrot a ghost is born featured songs that were created with pro tools before ever performing them live the album featured the song less than you think which included a fifteenminute track of electronic noises and synthesizers which tweedy called the track that everyone will hate tweedy justified the inclusion of the songi know ninetynine percent of our fans wont like that song theyll say its a ridiculous indulgence even i dont want to listen to it every time i play through the album but the times i do calm myself down and pay attention to it i think its valuable and moving and cathartic i wouldnt have put it on the record if i didnt think it was great i wanted to make an album about identity and within that is the idea of a higher power the idea of randomness and that anything can happen and that we cant control itleroy bach left the band immediately after the albums completion to join a music theatre operation in

last two albums whatever happened i apologize and kicking at the perfumed air on april 23 2022the new film does a wonderful job of capturing the quirkiness inventiveness and brilliance of someone who never met an instrument he couldnt play bennett once described hearing the open spaces of the songs and holes that became his sonic landscape they were at the core of the remarkable string of wilcos albums being there summerteeth and yankee hotel foxtrotthe film was originally started by uhter who asked the prolific bechard to take over the project when it stalled it takes a hard look at bennetts treatment in the previous wilco documentary i am trying to break your heart which many consider to be unfair jay bennetts reputation never quite recovered from the battering it took in sam jones documentary i am trying to break your heart a film about wilco about the complex lengthy gestation of 2002s yankee hotel foxtrot in often painful detail portrayed a band slowly pulling itself apart with chief songwriters bennett and jeff tweedy its twin opposing forces the implication being that bennett was a headstrong intractable figure responsible for most of the discord he was sacked as soon as the album was done filmmakers gorman bechard and fred uhter seek to redress the balance on where are you jay bennett the film painted a much more balanced picture of the relationship between bennett and tweedy they just happened to be two egos at that point fueled by a lot of demons and it just wasnt working anymore bechard explained theyre both incredibly talented they both had egos they both i think saw maybe different paths for the band and ultimately it was jeffs band so hes going to win that and rightfully so there were other issues whether it be alcohol or drugs you know it was a little bit of everything personally i wish they had stayed together because i think they could have literally become the next lennon and mccartney or the next jaggerrichardsin april 2022 the band announced their twelfth studio album cruel country which they released on may 27 the album was recorded entirely in person in live sessions at the loft the first album since 2007s sky blue sky tweedy

and folk rock wilco draws influence from bands from a variety of musical genres but primarily from music created between 1966 and 1974 john cales paris 1919 was credited by the band as providing a musical parallel according to tweedy it was eyeopening that i wasnt the only person that felt like these worlds had a lot more in common than theyd been given credit for—that experimentation and avantgarde theory was not directly opposed to beauty yknowother recording artists from the timespan cited as most influential by the band include john lennon neil young and brian wilson as a gift for his thirtyfourth birthday tweedy received a private guitar lesson from richard lloyd of television tweedy was a fan of the group and was particularly fond of the guitar work which he wanted to incorporate into his music uncle tupelo was inspired by bands such as jason the scorchers and the minutemen influencing the recording of wilcos am tweedy and orourke enjoyed free jazz artists such as ornette coleman albert ayler and derek bailey they also listen to mainstream jazz by artists such as miles davis and john coltrane the lyrical structure of wilcos songs was dictated by classic literature and cadavre exquis—an exercise where band members take turns writing lines on a typewriter but are only allowed to see the previously written line among the books that the band has cited as being stylistically influential include william h gasss in the heart of the heart of the country henry millers tropic of cancer and harold blooms the anxiety of influence a theory of poetrysome critics have dubbed wilco the american radiohead due to the bands stylistically diverse catalog a critic from the new york times argues that wilco has a rootsrock reached back to proven materials the twang of country the steady chug of 1960s rock the undulating sheen of the beach boys the honkytonk hymns of the band and the melodic symmetries of poprolling stone described wilco as one of americas most consistently interesting bands and americas foremost rock impressionists bands that wilco has influenced include derek webb of caedmons call the national and grace potter and the nocturnals adam
