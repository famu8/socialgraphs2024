the bering strait russian берингов пролив romanized beringov proliv is a strait between the pacific and arctic oceans separating the chukchi peninsula of the russian far east from the seward peninsula of alaska the present russiaunited states maritime boundary is at 168° 58 37 w longitude slightly south of the arctic circle at about 65° 40 n latitude the strait is named after vitus bering a danishborn russian explorerthe bering strait has been the subject of the scientific theory that humans migrated from asia to north america across a land bridge known as beringia when lower ocean levels – a result of glaciers locking up vast amounts of water – exposed a wide stretch of the sea floor both at the present strait and in the shallow sea north and south of it this view of how paleoindians entered america has been the dominant one for several decades and continues to be the most accepted one numerous successful crossings without the use of a boat have also been recorded since at least the early 20th centurythe bering strait is about 82 kilometers 51 mi wide at its narrowest point between cape dezhnev chukchi peninsula russia the easternmost point 169° 39 w of the asian continent and cape prince of wales alaska united states the westernmost point 168° 05 w of the north american continent its deepest point is only 90 m 300 ft in depth it borders the chukchi sea part of the arctic ocean to the north and the bering sea to the south the strait is a unique habitat sparsely populated by the yupik inuit and chukchi people who have cultural and linguistic ties to each otherfrom at least 1562 european geographers thought that there was a strait of anián between asia and north america in 1648 semyon dezhnyov probably passed through the strait but his report did not reach europe danishborn russian navigator vitus bering entered it in 1728 in 1732 mikhail gvozdev crossed it for the first time from asia to america it was visited in 1778 by the third voyage of james cookamerican vessels were hunting for bowhead whales in the strait by 1847in march 1913 captain max gottschalk german crossed from the east cape of siberia to shishmaref alaska on dogsled via little and big diomede islands he was the first documented modern voyager to cross from russia to north america without the use of a boatin 1987 swimmer lynne cox swam a 43kilometer 27 mi course between the diomede islands from alaska to the soviet union in 33 °c 379 °f water during the last years of the cold war she was congratulated jointly by american president ronald reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachevin june and july 1989 three independent teams attempted the first modern seakayak crossing of the bering strait the groups were seven alaskans who called their effort paddling into tomorrow ie crossing the international dateline a fourman british expedition kayaks across the bering strait and a team of californians in a threeperson baidarka led by jim noyes who launched his ambitious expedition as a paraplegic accompanying the californians was a film crew in a umiak a walrusskin boat traditional to the region they were filming the 1991 documentary curtain of ice directed by john armstrongin march 2006 briton karl bushby and frenchamerican adventurer dimitri kieffer crossed the strait on foot walking across a frozen 90kilometer 56 mi section in 15 days they were soon arrested for not entering russia through a regular port of entryaugust 2008 marked the first crossing of the bering strait using an amphibious roadgoing vehicle the specially modified land rover defender 110 was driven by steve burgess and dan evans across the straits on its second attempt following the interruption of the first by bad weatherin february 2012 a korean team led by hong sungtaek crossed the straits on foot in six days they started from chukotka peninsula the east coast of russia on february 23 and arrived in wales the western coastal town in alaska on february 29in july 2012 six adventurers associated with dangerous waters a reality adventure show under production made the crossing on seadoos but were arrested and permitted to return to alaska on their seadoos after being briefly detained in lavrentiya the administrative center of the chukotsky district they were treated well and given a tour of the villages museum but not permitted to continue south along the pacific coast the men had visas but the western coast of the bering strait is a closed military zonebetween august 4 and 10 us time 2013 a team of 65 swimmers from 17 countries performed a relay swim across the bering strait the first such swim in history they swam from cape dezhnev russia to cape prince of wales united states roughly 110 kilometers 68 mi due to the current they had direct support from the russian navy using one of its ships and assistance with permissiona physical link between asia and north america via the bering strait nearly became a reality in 1864 when a russianamerican telegraph company began preparations for an overland telegraph line connecting europe and america via the east it was abandoned when the undersea atlantic cable proved successfula further proposal for a bridgeandtunnel link from eastern russia to alaska was made by french engineer baron loicq de lobel in 1906 czar nicholas ii of russia issued an order authorising a francoamerican syndicate represented by de lobel to begin work on the transsiberian alaska railroad project but no physical work ever commencedsuggestions have been made to construct a bering strait bridge between alaska and siberia despite the unprecedented engineering political and financial challenges russia greenlit a us65billion tkmworld link tunnel project in august 2011 if completed the 103kilometer 64 mi tunnel would be the worlds longest china considered construction of a chinarussiacanadaamerica railroad line that would include construction of a 200kilometerlong 120 mi underwater tunnel that would cross the bering straitin 1956 the soviet union proposed to the us a joint binational project to warm the arctic ocean and melt some of the ice cap as designed by petr borisov the soviet project called for a 90kilometerwide 56 mi dam across the bering strait it would block the cold pacific current from entering the arctic by pumping lowsalinity cold surface water across the dam to the pacific warmer and higher salinity sea water from the atlantic ocean would be introduced into the arctic ocean however citing national security concerns the cia and fbi experts opposed the soviet plan by arguing that while the plan was feasible it would compromise norad and thus the dam could be built at only an immense cost soviet scientist d a drogaytsev also opposed the idea stating that the sea north of the dam and northflowing rivers in siberia would become unnavigable year round and the gobi and other deserts would be extended to the northern siberia coastlineamerican charles p steinmetz 1865–1923 earlier proposed to widen the bering strait by removing st lawrence island and parts of seward and chukotski peninsulas a strait 320 kilometers 200 mi wide would let the japan current melt the arctic oceanin the 21st century a 300kilometer 190 mi dam has also been proposed however the aim of the proposal is to preserve the arctic ice cap against global warmingduring the cold war the bering strait marked the border between the soviet union and the united states the diomede islands—big diomede russia and little diomede us—are only 38 km 24 mi apart traditionally the indigenous people in the area had frequently crossed the border back and forth for routine visits seasonal festivals and subsistence trade but were prevented from doing so during the cold war the border became known as the ice curtain it was completely closed and there was no regular passenger air or boat trafficsince 2012 the russian coast of the bering strait has been a closed military zone through organized trips and the use of special permits it is possible for foreigners to visit all arrivals must be through an airport or a cruise port near the bering strait only at anadyr or provideniya unauthorized travelers who arrive on shore after crossing the strait even those with visas may be arrested imprisoned briefly fined deported and banned from future visas
