culture the arlington heights illinois daily heralds mark guarino observed that revival was cheered and scrutinized as a staunch revivalist of depressionera music only because her originals sounded so

almanackwelch and rawlings incorporate elements of early twentieth century music such as old time classic country gospel and traditional bluegrass with modern elements of rhythm and blues rock n roll jazz and punk rock the new yorkers alec wilkinson maintained their musical style is not easily classified—it is at once innovative and obliquely reminiscent of past rural formsthe instrumentation on their songs is usually a simple arrangement with welch and rawlings accompanying their own vocals with acoustic guitars banjos or a mandolin welch plays rhythm guitar with a 1956 gibson j50 or banjo while rawlings plays lead on a 1935 epiphone olympic guitar the new yorkers wilkinson described rawlings as a strikingly inventive guitarist who plays solos that are daring melodic leaps a review in no depression by andy moore observed that rawlings squeezes strokes chokes and does just about everything but blow into his guitarmany songs performed by welch and rawlings contain dark themes about social outcasts struggling against such elements as poverty drug addiction death a disconnection from their family and an unresponsive god despite welch being the lead singer several of these characters are male welch has commented to be commercial everybody wants happy love songs people would flatout ask me dont you have any happy love songs well as a matter of fact i dont ive got songs about orphans and morphine addicts to reflect these themes welch and rawlings often employ a slow pace to their songs their tempo is compared to a slow heartbeat and cowperthwait of rolling stone

singersongwriters of her generation in 2003 tom kielty of the boston globe observed that she was quietly establishing one of the most impressive catalogs in contemporary roots music and a 2007 piece in the guardian by john harris called welch one of the decades greatest talents critic robert hilburn of the los angeles times wrote at every turn she demonstrates a spark and commitment that should endear her to anyone from country and folk to pop and rock fans who appreciate imagination and heartwhen welchs first two albums came out critics questioned the authenticity of her music as she was raised in southern california but performed appalachian themed songs for revival welch was criticized for manufacturing emotion and a review of hell among the yearlings by chris herrington of city pages stated welch is someone who discovered oldtime music in college and decided that her own sheltered life could never be worth writing about and that she is completely devoid of individuality other critics rejected the notion that her background affects the authenticity of her music music critic mark kemp defended welch in a new york times piecethe firstperson protagonist of ms welchs song caleb meyer may be a young girl from a time and place that ms welch will never fully understand but the feelings the singer expresses about rape and the respect she displays for her chosen musical genre are nothing if not poignantly authentic likewise it matters not whether ms welch has ever walked the streets of the black dust towns of east tennessee about which she sings in miners refrain because the sense of foreboding that she expresses for the men who once labored in coal mines with futile hopes of a better life comes through loud and clear the wall street journals taylor holliday echoed this stingy critics give ms welch a hard time because shes a california city girl not an appalachian coal miners daughter but as lucinda or emmylou might attest love of the music is not a birthright but an earned right listen to ms welch yodel in a tune about that nogood gal morphine and you know shes as mountain as they comeon september 16 2015 the duo was awarded the lifetime achievement award for songwriting by the americana music association it wasnt until i became friends with dave and gil about ten years ago that i had people who understood songwriting and could express it to me in a way that left out the guesswork—ketch secor old crow medicine showwelch emphasizes music from a previous era as her major influence she said that by and large i listen to people who are dead im really of the triedandtrue school i let 50 years go by and see whats really relevant welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists including the stanley brothers the carter family the louvin brothers and the blue sky boys she explained her relationship with traditional music by saying ive never tried to be traditional its been a springboard for me and i love it and revere it and would not be doing what i do without the music of the monroe brothers the stanley brothers and the carter family however it was clear i was never going to be able to do exactly that im a songwriterin addition to the strong country influence welch also draws on a repertoire of such rock n roll artists as bob dylan chuck berry neil young the grateful dead and the velvet underground she has noted alternative rock bands throwing muses pixies and camper van beethoven dont directly inform my music but theyre in there her cover of black star by radiohead became wellknown and was released as a single in 2005welch has recorded songs with a variety of notable artists including ryan adams ani difranco emmylou harris jay farrar alison krauss old crow medicine
