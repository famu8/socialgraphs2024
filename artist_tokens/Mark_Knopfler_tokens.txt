fans this was to be dire straits final world tour it was not as well received as the previous brothers in arms tour and by this time mark knopfler had had enough of such huge operations manager ed bicknell is quoted as saying the last tour was utter misery whatever the zeitgeist was that we had been part of it had passed john illsley agreed saying personal relationships were in trouble and it

was pretty happy when the bands run came to an end recalling feeling mentally physically and emotionally exhausted by the time dire straits disbanded at the time illsley also said i can openly admit to you that i really enjoyed the success of the band im speaking for mark as well we both really enjoyed it comes with a certain amount of stress obviously youve got to really dig deep sometimes to
