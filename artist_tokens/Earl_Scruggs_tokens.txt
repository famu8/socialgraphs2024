bluegrass music his threefinger style of playing was radically different from the traditional way the fivestring banjo had previously been played this new style of playing became popular and elevated the banjo from its previous role as a background rhythm instrument to featured solo status he popularized the instrument across several genres of musicscruggs career began at age 21 when he was hired to play in bill monroes band the blue grass boys bluegrass eventually became the name for an entire genre of country music despite considerable success with monroe performing on the grand ole opry and recording classic hits such as blue moon of kentucky scruggs resigned from the group in 1948 because of their exhausting touring schedule fellow band member lester flatt resigned as well and he and scruggs later paired up in the duo flatt and scruggs scruggs banjo instrumental foggy mountain breakdown was recorded in december 1949 and released in march 1950 the song became an enduring hit the song experienced a rebirth of popularity to a younger generation when it was featured in the 1967 film bonnie and clyde the song won two grammy awards and in 2005 was selected for the library of congress national recording registry of works of unusual meritflatt and scruggs brought bluegrass music into mainstream popularity in the early 1960s with their country hit the ballad of jed clampett the theme music for the television sitcom the beverly hillbillies—the first scruggs recording to reach number one on the billboard charts over their 20year association flatt and scruggs recorded over 50 albums and 75 singles the duo broke up in 1969 chiefly because while scruggs wanted to switch styles to fit a more modern sound flatt was a traditionalist who opposed the change and believed doing so would alienate a fan base of bluegrass purists although each of them formed a new band to match their visions neither of them ever regained the success they had achieved as a teamscruggs received four grammy awards a grammy lifetime achievement award and a national medal of arts he became a member of the international bluegrass music hall of fame and was given a star on the hollywood walk of fame in 1985 flatt and scruggs were inducted together into the country music hall of fame and named as a duo number 24 on cmts 40 greatest men of country music scruggs was awarded a national heritage fellowship by the national endowment for the arts the highest honor in the folk and traditional arts in the united states four works by scruggs have been placed in the grammy hall of fame after scruggs death in 2012 at age 88 the earl scruggs center was founded in shelby north carolina near his birthplace with the aid of a federal grant and corporate donors the center is a 55 million facility that features the musical contributions of scruggs and serves as an educational center providing classes and field trips for studentsearl scruggs was born january 6 1924 in the flint hill community of cleveland county north carolina a small community just outside of boiling springs about 10 miles west of shelby his father george elam scruggs was a farmer and a bookkeeper who died of a protracted illness when earl was four years old upon his fathers death scruggs mother georgia lula ruppe called lula was left to take care of the farm and five children of which earl was the youngestthe family members all played music the father played an open back banjo using the frailing technique though as an adult earl had no recollection of his fathers playing mrs scruggs played the pump organ earls siblings older brothers junie and horace and older sisters eula mae and ruby all played banjo and guitar scruggs recalled a visit to his uncles home at age six to hear a blind banjo player named mack woolbright who played a fingerpicking style and had recorded for columbia records it made an impression on scruggs who said hed sit in the rocking chair and hed pick some and it was just amazing i couldnt imagine—he was the first what i call a good banjo player scruggs then took up the instrument—he was too small to hold it at first and improvised by setting his brother junies banjo beside him on the floor he moved it around depending on what part of the neck he was playing after his fathers death scruggs seemed to take solace in playing music and when not in school or doing farm chores spent nearly every spare moment he had practicing his first radio performance was at age 11 on a talent scout show because his father had died scruggs was deferred from military service in world war ii so he could support his motherscruggs is noted for popularizing a threefinger banjopicking style now called scruggs style that has become a defining characteristic of bluegrass music prior to scruggs most banjo players used the frailing or clawhammer technique which consists of holding the fingers bent like a claw and moving the entire hand in a downward motion so that the strings are struck with the back of the middle fingernail this motion is followed by striking the thumb on a single string the threefinger style of playing is radically different from frailing the hand remains stationary and only the fingers and thumb move somewhat similar to classical guitar technique scruggs style also involves using picks on three digits see photo each plucking individual strings—downward with the thumb then upward with the index and middle finger in sequence when done skillfully and in rapid sequence the style allows any digit though usually the thumb to play a melody while the other two digits play arpeggios of the melody line the use of picks gives each note a louder percussive attack creating an exciting effect described by the new york times as like thumbtacks plinking rhythmically on a tin roof this departure from traditional playing elevated the banjo to become more of a solo instrument—a promotion from its former role of providing background rhythm or serving as a comedians prop—and popularized the instrument in several genres of musicearl scruggs did not invent threefinger banjo playing in fact he said the threefinger style was the most common way to play the fivestring banjo in his hometown in western north carolina an early influence was a local banjoist dewitt snuffy jenkins who plucked in a finger style according to banjoist and historian tony trischka jenkins came about as close as one could to scruggs style without actually playing it at age ten when scruggs first learned the technique he recalled that he was at home in his room after a quarrel with his brother he was idly playing a song called reuben and suddenly realized that he was playing with three fingers not two that excited me to no end he later recalled and said he ran through the house repeatedly yelling ive got it from there he devoted all his free time to perfecting his timing and to adding syncopation and variations to it controversy exists as to the actual origin of threefinger picking style don reno an eminent banjo player who also played this style and who knew scruggs at that young age described scruggs early playing as similar to that of snuffy jenkins scruggs however consistently referred to it as his own saying that he adapted to it a syncopated roll that was quite different on the subject john hartford said heres the way i feel about it everybodys all worried about who invented the style and its obvious that three finger banjo pickers have been around a long time—maybe since 1840 but its my feeling that if it wasnt for earl scruggs you wouldnt be worried about who invented itat age 15 scruggs played in a group called the morris brothers for a few months but quit to work in a factory making sewing thread in the lily textile mill near his home in north carolina he worked there about two years earning 40 cents an hour until the draft restriction for world war ii was lifted in 1945 at which time he returned to music performing with lost john miller and his allied kentuckians on wnox in knoxville about this time an opening to play with bill monroe became availablebill monroe 13 years older than scruggs was prominent in country music at the time his career started with the monroe brothers a duo with his brother charlie bill sang the high tenor harmony parts a sound called high lonesome for which he became noted the brothers split up in 1938 and bill a native of the bluegrass state of kentucky formed a new group called bill monroe and the blue grass boys they first played on the opry in 1939 and soon became a popular touring band featuring a vocalist named lester flatt the name bluegrass stuck and eventually became the eponym for this entire genre of country music and monroe became known as the father of bluegrasswhen scruggs was 21 monroe was looking for a banjo player for his group because david stringbean akeman was quitting at the time banjo players often functioned in the band as comedians and the instrument was often held as a prop—their clawhammer playing was almost inaudible monroe along with band member lester flatt auditioned several banjo players who had the same traditional playing style as akeman when scruggs auditioned for them at the tulane hotel in nashville flatt said i was thrilled it was so different i had never heard that kind of banjo picking scruggs joined monroe in late 1945 earning 50 a week after they accepted scruggs as one of the blue grass boys the roster consisted of bill monroe vocalsmandolin lester flatt guitarvocals earl scruggs banjo chubby wise fiddle and howard watts stage name cedric rainwater on bass this group of men became the prototype of what a bluegrass band would becomewith monroe and lester flatt scruggs performed on the grand ole opry and in september 1946 recorded the classic hit blue moon of kentucky a song that was designated by the library of congress to be added to the national recording registry and later added to the grammy hall of fame the work schedule was heavy in monroes band they were playing a lot of jobs in movie theaters all over the south riding in a 1941 chevrolet from town to town doing up to six shows a day and not finishing up until about eleven at night lester flatt said it wasnt anything to ride two or three days in a car we didnt have buses like we do now and we never had our shoes off the selfimposed rule was to always get back in time to play the grand ole opry in nashville each saturday night scruggs said of monroe that bill would never let the music go down no matter how tired we were if a man would slack off he would move over and get that mandolin up close on him and get him back up there despite the groups success scruggs decided the demands were too great he was single at the time and the brief few hours on saturdays that he made it home it was just to pack his suitcase at the tulane hotel where he lived alone then repeat the cycle—he had done this for two years he turned in his resignation planning to go take care of his mother in north carolina flatt had also made up his mind to leave but he had not told anyone he later gave his twoweek notice but before the notice was up the bass player howard watts announced that he was leaving too despite monroes pleading they left the band monroe thought flatt and scruggs had a secret understanding but both men denied it monroe did not speak to either one for 20 years thereafter a feud well known in country music circlesin 1948 lester flatt and earl scruggs formed the duo flatt and scruggs and chose the name the foggy mountain boys for their backing band the name came from a song by the carter family called foggy mountain top that the band used as a theme song at the time flatt later acknowledged that they consciously tried to make their sound different from monroes group in the spring of 1949 their second mercury recording session yielded the classic foggy mountain breakdown released on 78 rpm phonograph records that were in use at the time in the mid1950s they dropped the mandolin and added a dobro played by buck uncle josh graves previously scruggs had performed something similar called bluegrass breakdown with bill monroe but monroe had denied him songwriting credit for it later scruggs changed the song adding a minor chord thus creating foggy mountain breakdown the song contains a musical oddity flatt plays an e major chord against scruggss e minor when asked about the dissonance years later scruggs said he had tried to get flatt to consistently play a minor there to no avail he said he eventually became used to the sound and even fond of it the song won a grammy and became an anthem for many banjo players to attempt to master the band routinely tuned its instruments a halfstep higher than standard tuning in those days to get more brightness or pop to the sound returning to standard pitch in the 1960sthe popularity of foggy mountain breakdown resurged years later when it was featured in the 1967 film bonnie and clyde which introduced the song to a younger generation of fans scruggs received a phone call from the shows producer and star warren beatty first asking scruggs to write a song for the movie soon beatty called back saying that he wanted to use the existing vintage mercury recording of foggy mountain breakdown and rejected the argument that it was recorded 18 years prior at a radio station with no modern enhancements the film was a hit called by the los angeles times a landmark film that helped usher in a new era in american filmmaking in 2005 the song was selected for the library of congresss national recording registry of works of unusual meritin october 1951 the band recorded earls breakdown which featured a technique where scruggs would manually detune the second and third strings of the banjo during a song using a cam device he had made to attach to the instrument giving the surprise effect of a downward string bend he and his brother horace had experimented with it when they were growing up scruggs had drilled some holes in the peghead of his banjo to install the device and chipped the pearl inlay he covered the holes with a piece of metal which can be seen on the album cover of foggy mountain jamboree the technique became popular and led to improvement of the design without drilling holes by bill keith who then manufactured scruggskeith tuners the original tuners scruggs made and used are now in a museum display at the earl scruggs center in shelby north carolinain 1953 martha white foods sponsored the bands regular early morning radio shows on wsm in nashville where the duo sang the companys catchy bluegrass jingle written by pat twitty about this time country music television shows on which flatt and scruggs appeared regularly went into syndication vastly increasing the groups exposure despite the groups increasing popularity and fan mail wsm did not allow flatt and scruggs to become members of the grand ole opry at first according to tennessean writer peter cooper bill monroe was in opposition and worked behind the scenes to keep flatt and scruggs off the opry to the extent of having petitions made against their membership in 1955 martha white foods ceo cohen e williams intervened by threatening to pull all of his advertising from wsm unless the band appeared on the opry in the segment sponsored by his company as years went by the band became synonymous with martha white to the extent that the advertising jingle became a hit and the band rarely played a concert without it fans shouted requests for them to play it even at carnegie hallon september 24 1962 the duo recorded the ballad of jed clampett for the tv show the beverly hillbillies sung by jerry scoggins the theme song became an immediate country music hit and was played at the beginning and end of each episode of the series the song went to 1 on the billboard country chart a first for any bluegrass recording the song spent 20 weeks on that chart it also reached 44 on billboards pop chart the television show was also a huge hit broadcast in 76 countries around the world in queens new york a fiveyearold boy named béla fleck heard the jed clampett theme on television fleck said i couldnt breathe or think i was completely mesmerized he said it awakened a deeply embedded predisposition that was just in there to learn how to play the banjo flatt and scruggs appeared in several episodes as family friends of the fictional clampetts in their first appearance season 1 episode 20 they portray themselves in the show and perform both the theme song and pearl pearl pearl that song went to 8 on the country chart in 1963 scruggs published an instruction book entitled earl scruggs and the five string banjo in 1968 it received a gold book award by the publisher peersouthern corporation when it sold over a million copies over their 20year association flatt and scruggs recorded over 50 albums and 75 single records and featured over 20 different musicians as foggy mountain boys—side men backing the duoby the end of the 1960s scruggs was getting bored with repetition of the classic bluegrass fare by now his sons were professional musicians and he was caught up in their enthusiasm for more contemporary music he said i love bluegrass music and still like to play it but i do like to mix in some other music for my own personal satisfaction because if i dont i can get a little bogged down and a little depressed scruggs also wanted to play concerts in venues that normally featured rock and roll acts columbia records executives told flatt and scruggs that they intended to try a new producer bob johnston instead of their longtime producer don law johnston had produced bob dylans records this new association produced changin times nashville airplane and the story of bonnie and clyde albums flatt was not happy with some of this material—he didnt like singing bob dylan songs and refused to perform them saying i cant sing bob dylan stuff i mean columbia has got bob dylan why did they want me even the success of the bonnie and clyde album was not enough to prevent their breakup in 1969 after the split flatt formed a traditional bluegrass group with curly seckler and marty stuart called the nashville grass and scruggs formed the earl scruggs revue with his sonsneither flatt nor scruggs spoke to each other for the next ten years—until 1979 when flatt was in the hospital scruggs made an unannounced visit to his bedside the two men talked for more than an hour even though flatts voice was barely above a whisper he spoke of a reunion scruggs answered yes but told flatt they would talk when he was better flatt said it came as quite a surprise and made me feel good however flatt never recovered and died may 11 1979 historian barry willis speaking of the meeting said earl gave lester his flowers while he was still living he was referring to a 1957 flatt and scruggs recording of give me my flowers while im still livingin early 1969 scruggs formed the earl scruggs revue consisting of two of his sons randy guitar and gary bass and later vassar clements fiddle josh graves dobro and scruggs youngest son steve drums on november 15 1969 scruggs performed live with the newly formed group on an openair stage in washington dc at the moratorium to end the war in vietnam scruggs was one of the few bluegrass or country artists to give support to the antiwar movement the earl scruggs revue gained popularity on college campuses live shows and festivals and appeared on the bill with acts like steppenwolf the byrds and james taylor they recorded for columbia records and made frequent network television appearances though the 1970s their album i saw the light with a little help from my friends featured linda ronstadt arlo guthrie tracy nelson and the nitty gritty dirt band this collaboration sparked enthusiasm by the latter to make the album will the circle be unbroken earl and louise scruggs made phone calls to eminent country stars like roy acuff and mother maybelle carter to get them to participate in this project to bring a unique combination of older players with young ones bill monroe refused to participate saying he had to remain true to the style he pioneered and this is not bluegrass the album became a classic and was selected for the library of congress national recording registry of works of unusual meritscruggs had to retire from the road in 1980 because of back problems but the earl scruggs revue did not part ways until 1982 despite the groups commercial success they were never embraced by bluegrass or country music purists scruggs remained active musically and released the storyteller and the banjoman with tom t hall in 1982 and a compilation album top of the world in 1983 in 1994 scruggs teamed up with randy scruggs and doc watson to contribute the song keep on the sunny side to the aids benefit album red hot

the late 1950s scruggs met with bill nelson one of the owners of the vega musical instrument company in boston to sign a contract to design and endorse a new banjo to be called the earl scruggs model the company had made banjos since before 1912 and already had a pete seeger model there would be four scruggs models in the topoftheline banjos they produced it was the first time a prominent bluegrass banjo player had played any brand other than a gibson scruggs participated in vegas marketing campaign that claimed that the banjo was constructed to scruggss design specifications which was true but the finished product fell short of his expectations according to scruggss friend and fellow banjoist curtis mcpeake scruggs never cared for it mcpeake stated they were good banjos they just wasnt what earl wanted to play scruggs continued to perform and record using his gibson granada the vega company was sold to the cf martin company in 1970 and the contract was dissolvedin 1984 gibson produced what scruggs had wanted—the gibson earl scruggs standard a replica of his personal 1934 gibson granada rb mastertone banjo number 95843 this banjo had been changed over its long existence and the only remaining original parts were the rim the tone ring and the resonator the wooden back of the instrument the banjo was originally goldplated but the gold had longsince worn off and had been replaced with nickel hardware gibson elected to make the replica model nickelplated as well to look like scruggs own scruggs actual 1934 model was previously owned by a series of influential players beginning with snuffy jenkins who bought it for 3750 at a pawn shop in south carolina jenkins sold it to don reno who sold it to scruggs when scruggs acquired it the instrument was in poor condition and he sent it to the gibson company for refurbishing including a new fingerboard pearl inlays and a more slender neck during this time scruggs used his gibson rb3 for some of the mercury recording sessions banjo enthusiasts have located the shipping records from gibson to determine the exact dates the granada mastertone was missing on certain recordingson may 22 2023 scruggs personal gibson

half later in april 1948 when flatt and scruggs formed the new group scruggs had done most of the bookings for the band but being on the road for hours in a car and stopping at a phone booth to
