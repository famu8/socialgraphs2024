cast screen gems bought his songs so they could be used in the show many of the songs nesmith wrote for the monkees such as the girl i knew somewhere mary mary and listen to the band became minor hits

independent press conference nesmith called their 2nd lp more of the monkees probably the worst record in the history of the world partly due to rushed shoddy studio engineering the band took a hit to its artistic credibility when fans learned the four had not played all the instruments on the first 2 lps but still sales continued to be profitable headquarters sold 2 million copies down 2 million units from its predecessor but still reached the number 1 spot on billboard falling only to sgt peppers lonely hearts club band a week later and remaining 2 all through the entire 1967 summer of
