passenger trains trains with names in italicized bold text still operate under amtrakthe man or men who committed this horrible deed near glendale may not be anarchists technically speaking but if they are sane men moved by motive they are such stuff as anarchists are made of if the typical anarchist conceived that a railroad corporation should be terrorized he would not scruple to wreck a passenger train and send scores and hundreds to instant deaththere are many southern pacific locomotives still in revenue service with railroads such as the union pacific railroad and many older and special locomotives have been donated to parks and museums or continue operating on scenic or tourist railroads most of the engines now in use with union pacific have been patched where the sp logo on the front is replaced by a union pacific shield and new numbers are applied over the old numbers with a union pacific sticker however some engines remain in southern pacific bloody nose paint over the
