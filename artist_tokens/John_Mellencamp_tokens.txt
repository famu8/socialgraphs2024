management who was receptive to his music and image defries insisted that mellencamps first album chestnut street incident a collection of cover versions and some original songs be released under the stage name johnny cougar claiming that the name mellencamp was too hard to market mellencamp reluctantly agreed but the album was a commercial failure selling only 12000 copies mellencamp confessed in a 2005 interviewthat was put on me by some manager i went to new york and everybody said you sound like a hillbilly and i said well i am so thats where he came up with that name i was totally unaware of it until it showed up on the album jacket when i objected to it he said well either youre going to go for it or were not going to put the record out so that was what i had to do but i thought the name was pretty sillymellencamp recorded the kid inside the followup to chestnut street incident in 1977 however defries eventually decided against releasing the album and mellencamp was dropped from

became a no 28 single in late 1979 pat benatar recorded i need a lover on her debut album in the heat of the nightin 1980 mellencamp returned with the steve cropperproduced nothin matters and what if it did which yielded two top 40 singles – this time no 27 and aint even done with the night no 17 the singles were stupid little pop songs he told record magazine in 1983i take no credit for that record it wasnt like the title was made up – it wasnt supposed to be punky or cocky like some people thought toward the end i didnt even go to the studio me and the guys in the band thought we were finished anyway it was the most expensive record i ever made it cost 280000 do you believe that the worst thing was that i could have gone on making records like that for hundreds of years hell as long as you sell a few records and the record company isnt putting a lot of money into promotion youre making money for em and thats all they care about polygram loved nothin matters they thought i was going to turn into the next neil diamondin 1982 mellencamp released his breakthrough album american fool which contained the singles hurts so good an uptempo rock tune that spent four weeks at no 2 and 16 weeks in the top 10 and jack diane which was a no 1 hit for four weeks a third single hand to hold on to made it to no 19 hurts so good went on to win the grammy award for best male rock vocal performance at the 25th grammysto be real honest theres three good songs on that record and the rest is just sort of filler it was too labored over too thought about and it wasnt organic enough the record company thought it would bomb but i think the reason it took off was – not that the songs were better than my others – but people liked the sound of it the bambambam drums it was a different soundwith some commercial success under his belt mellencamp had enough influence to force the record company to add his real surname mellencamp to his stage moniker the first album recorded under his new name john cougar mellencamp was 1983s uhhuh a top10 album that spawned the top 10 singles pink houses and crumblin down as well as the no 15 hit authority song which he said is our version of i fought the law during the recording of uhhuh mellencamps backing band settled on the lineup it retained for the next several albums kenny aronoff on drums and percussion larry crane and mike wanchic on guitars toby myers on bass and john cascella on keyboards in 1988 rolling stone magazine called this version of mellencamps band one of the most powerful and versatile live bands ever assembled on the 1984 uhhuh tour mellencamp opened his shows with cover versions of songs he admired growing up including elvis presleys heartbreak hotel the animals dont let me be misunderstood lee dorseys ya ya and the left bankes pretty ballerinain 1985 mellencamp released scarecrow which peaked at no 2 in the fall of 1985 and spawned five top 40 singles lonely ol night and small town both no 6 rock in the usa no 2 rain on the scarecrow no 21 and rumble seat no 28 according to the february 1986 edition of creem magazine mellencamp wanted to incorporate the sound of classic 60s rock into scarecrow and he gave his band close to a hundred old singles to learn almost mathematically verbatim prior to recording the albumlearning those songs did a lot of positive things we realized more than ever what a big melting pot of all different types of music the 60s were take an old rascals song for example – theres everything from marching band beats to soul music to country sounds in one song learning those opened the bands vision to try new things on my songs it wasnt lets go back and try to make this part fit into my song but i wanted to capture the same feeling – the way those songs used to make you feel after a while we didnt even have to talk about it anymore if you listen to the lead larry plays on face of the nation he never would have played that cause he didnt really know who the animals were hes young and he grew up listening to grand funk railroad you hear it and its like where did that come from it had to be from hearing those old recordsscarecrow was the first album mellencamp recorded at his own recording studio jokingly dubbed belmont mall located in belmont indiana and constructed in 1984 mellencamp sees scarecrow as the start of the alternative country genrei think i invented that whole no depression thing with the scarecrow album though i dont get the creditin the liner notes to mellencamps 2010 box set on the rural route 7609 anthony decurtis wrote of mellencamps influence on the no depression movementin finding his voice as a lyricist and activist mellencamp also crafted a more fitting musical vision for himself in the mid1980s within the context of what was still undeniably the sound of a rock roll band he began incorporating instruments more characteristic of folk and roots music—dulcimer mandolin fiddle accordion dobro and pennywhistle among them on albums like scarecrow 1985 the lonesome jubilee 1987 and big daddy 1989 mellencamp helped pioneer the sound of alternative country or no depression music that combines the truthtelling force of hardcore country with the instrumental attack of rock rollif he has not been properly credited for that groundbreaking role its largely because he committed the unforgivable sin of actually having hits while making innovative music part of the no depression mythology requires either a tragic early death or decades of unacknowledged masterpieces created during a life of grueling poverty writing and recording great songs that millions of people like and buy is not part of that sentimental picture—regardless of how comfortably the music itself sits within the genres parametersshortly after finishing scarecrow mellencamp helped organize the first farm aid benefit concert with willie nelson and neil young in champaign illinois on september 22 1985 farm aid concerts have remained an annual event over the past 39 years and as of 2024 the organization has raised nearly 80 million to promote a strong and resilient family farm system of agricultureprior to the 1985–86 scarecrow tour during which he covered some of the same 1960s rock and soul songs he and his band rehearsed prior to the recording of scarecrow mellencamp added fiddle player lisa germano to his band germano would remain in mellencamps band until 1994 when she left to pursue a solo careermellencamps next studio album 1987s the lonesome jubilee included the singles paper in fire no 9 cherry bomb no 8 check it out no 14 and rooty toot toot no 61 along with the popular album tracks hard times for an honest man and the real life both of which cracked the top 10 on the billboard album rock tracks chartwe were on the road for a long time after scarecrow so we were together a lot as a band for the first time ever we talked about the record before we started we had a very distinct vision of what should be happening here at one point the lonesome jubilee was supposed to be a double album but at least 10 of the songs id written just didnt stick together with the idea and the sound we had in mind so i just put those songs on a shelf and cut it back down to a single record now in the past it was always lets make it up as we go along – and we did make some of the lonesome jubilee up as we went along but we had a very clear idea of what we wanted it to sound like even before it was written right through to the day it was masteredas frank digiacomo of vanity fair wrote in 2007 the lonesome jubilee was the album in which mellencamp defined his now signature sound a rousing crystalline mix of acoustic and electric guitars appalachian fiddle and gospelstyle backing vocals anchored by a crisp bareknuckle drumbeat and completed by his own velveteen raspduring the 1987–88 lonesome jubilee tour mellencamp was joined onstage by surprise guest bruce springsteen at the end of his may 26 1988 gig in irvine california for a duet of bob dylans like a rolling stone which mellencamp performed as the penultimate song during each show on that tour said mellencamp of his band during the 198788 lonesome jubilee tourjust then we were the best band in the world bar none i mean we were really good all of that failure and frustration had energized every guy in the band to the infantile level of were going to show em all they were wrong it wasnt just me when we walked out onstage there wasnt a band on earth to touch us and it dont matter who you care to name ― u2 the rolling stones anybody we were better now we werent playing the best songs in the world a lot of my songs werent that great but they were good enough and as far as putting on a performance and entertaining goes we were undeniably great i wish i wouldve been able to enjoy it but i was too busy sluggingin 1989 mellencamp released the personal album big daddy with the key tracks jackie brown big daddy of them all and void in my heart accompanying the top 15 single pop singer the album which mellencamp called at the time the most earthy record hed ever made is also the last to feature the cougar moniker in 1991 mellencamp said big daddy was the best record i ever made out of my agony came a couple of really beautiful songs you cant be 22 years old and had two dates and understand that albummellencamp was heavily involved in painting at this time in his life and decided not to tour behind big daddywhats the point this other step that people keep wanting me to take to become another level of recording artist – to be madonna to sell out to bend over to kiss somebodys ass i aint gon na do it in his second painting exhibition at the churchmanfehsenfeld gallery in indianapolis in 1990 mellencamps portraits were described as always having sad facial expressions and conveying the same disillusionment found in his musical anthems about the nations heartland and farm crisismellencamps 1991 album whenever we wanted was the first with a cover billed to john mellencamp the cougar was finally dropped for good whenever we wanted yielded the top 40 hits get a leg up and again tonight but last chance love and happiness and now more than ever all garnered significant airplay on rock radioits very rock n roll i just wanted to get back to the basics john mellencampin 1993 he released human wheels and the title track peaked at no 48 on the billboard singles chart to me this record is very urban mellencamp told billboard magazine of human wheels in the summer of 1993we had a lot of discussions about the rhythm and blues music of the day we explored what a lot of these current bands are doing – these young black bands that are doing more than just sampling john mellencampmellencamps 1994 dance naked album included a cover of van morrisons wild night as a duet with meshell ndegeocello wild night became mellencamps biggest hit in years peaking at no 3 on the billboard hot 100 the album also contained two protest songs in luv and another sunny day 1225 in addition to the title track which hit no 41 on the hot 100 in the summer of 1994this is as naked a rock record as youre going to hear all the vocals are first or second takes and half the songs dont even have bass parts others have just one guitar bass and drums which i havent done since american foolwith guitarist andy york now on board as larry cranes fulltime replacement mellencamp launched his dance naked tour in the summer of 1994 but had a minor heart attack after a show at jones beach in new york on august 8 of that year that heart attack eventually forced him to cancel the last few weeks of the tour he returned to the concert stage in early 1995 by playing a series of dates in small midwestern clubs under the pseudonym pearl doggyin september 1996 the experimental album mr happy go lucky which was produced by junior vasquez was released to critical acclaimits been fascinating to me how urban records use rhythm and electronics and its terribly challenging to make that work in the context of a rock band but we took it further than an urban record the arrangements are more ambitious with programs and loops going right along with real drums and guitarsmr happy go lucky spawned the no 14 single key west intermezzo i saw you first mellencamps last top 40 hit and just another day which peaked at no 46after the release of mr happy go lucky and a subsequent fourmonth tour from march to july 1997 to promote it mellencamp signed a fouralbum deal with columbia records although he wound up making only three albums for the labelissued a day before his 47th birthday in 1998 his selftitled debut for columbia records included the singles your life is now and im not running anymore along with standout album tracks such as eden is burning miss missy it all comes true and chance meeting at the tarantula the switch in labels coincided with dane clark replacing aronoff on drums on this record we ended up quite a bit away from where we started mellencamp told guitar world acoustic in 1998initially i wanted to make a record that barely had drums on it donovan made a record in 1966 sunshine superman and i wanted to start with that same kind of vibe—eastern very grand stories fairy talesin 1999 mellencamp covered his own songs as well as those by bob dylan and the drifters for his album rough harvest recorded in 1997 one of two albums he owed mercury records to fulfill his contract the other was the best that i could do a bestof collection in may 2000

bestowed upon him an honorary doctorate of musical artsin august 2000 mellencamp played a series of unannounced free concerts in major cities on the east coast and in the midwest as a way of giving back to fans who had supported him the previous 24 years with a lofi setup that included portable amps and a batterypowered pa system mellencamp armed with an acoustic guitar and accompanied only by an accordionist and a violist dubbed the jaunt live in the streets the good samaritan tour at these dozen shows which ranged from 45 to 60 minutes mellencamp covered several rock and folk classics and

2007 he intended for freedoms road to have a 1960s rock sound while still remaining contemporary and he feels that goal was achievedwe wanted to make sure that it had the same feeling of some of the great songs from the 60s but also had the message of today and had the backbeat of today i think we came up with a pretty timelesssounding albumour country the first single from freedoms road was played as the opening song on mellencamps 2006 spring tour and the band that opened for him on that tour little big town was called on to record harmonies on the studio version of our country as well as seven other songs on freedoms roadalthough mellencamp had always been outspoken and adamant about not selling any of his songs to corporations for commercial use he changed his stance and let chevrolet use our country in chevy silverado tv commercials that began airing in late september 2006i agonized i still dont think we should have to do it but record companies cant spend money to promote records anymore unless youre u2 or madonna im taking heat because no ones ever done this before people have licensed songs that have already been hits but nobodys licensed a brandnew song to a major company and people dont know how to reactmellencamp sang our country to open game 2 of the 2006 world series and the song was nominated for a 2008 grammy award in the best solo rock vocal
