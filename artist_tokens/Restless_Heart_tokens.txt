known each other from attending oklahoma state university in the 1970s the two were also classmates of scott hendricks who would serve as the bands sound engineer in addition to coproducing with duboisthompson left before the band had officially been named or released a single because he did not feel comfortable with the country pop style that dubois wanted the band to pursue replacing him on lead vocals was larry stewart a college friend of inniss at the time stewart was working as a demo vocalist in addition to working in the stockrooms of the country music hall of fame and mowing lawns at the nashville offices of broadcast music inc bmi after leaving the group thompson recorded both by himself and in collaboration with guy clark in addition to writing several country hit singles in

and thenfianc√©e both of whom encouraged him to join the band then began rehearsing and recording demos with stewart on lead vocals as they had not officially selected a name yet they referred to themselves as the okie project due to three of the members and hendricks all being natives of oklahoma one of the demos they recorded was for love in the first degree later a hit for alabama due to the success of the demos the members chose to become an official band and they were signed to rca records nashville in 1984despite being signed the band had yet to select a name dubois insisted the band members come up with a name before they released a single he asked the members to submit potential names which resulted in a list with about fifty entries after this he locked all five members in an office for seven hours until they agreed on a name they narrowed the list down to five entries on which they then voted by using a fivepoint scale with five points for the names they liked most and one point for the ones they liked the least this initially led to the name heartbreak kid getting the most votes but after dubois asked the band members if they were certain they liked the name they voted a second time and chose the name restless heart due to it receiving one more point than the others once they had assumed the name restless heart the band members began working on recording an album with dubois and hendricks as producersafter assuming the name restless heart the band released its selftitled debut album on rca nashville in 1985 it charted four singles on billboard hot country songs let the heartache ride i want everyone to cry back to the heartbreak kid previously recorded by kathy mattea on her selftitled debut album and til i loved you dubois cowrote let the heartache ride and back to the heartbreak kid with van stephenson according to jennings some stations refused to play let the heartache ride due to its more country rock sound at a time when neotraditional country was beginning to rise in popularity john wooley of the tulsa world reviewed the album favorably praising the intricate tight harmonies and crisp instrumentation after i want everyone to cry became the bands first topten hit dubois and rca promoted the band through radio showcases and music video rotation this included a video for back to the heartbreak kid which aired on vh1 dubois felt that touring was not a financial necessity for the band at the time due to all five members also being session musicians and having songwriting contracts with warner music group at the time while under such a contract innis cowrote dare me a hit single for the pointer sistersdespite duboiss statements about touring the band began doing so in 1986 one of their first concerts was with rita coolidge in tulsa oklahoma also that year rca released the bands second album wheels all four singles from the album went to number one on the country music charts first was that rock wont roll a song which innis had initially thought was too pop to be a hit single on country radio until the song reached number one the followup single ill still be loving you was a song that had been originally offered to kenny rogers who turned it down it was bands second numberone country hit and their first song to be successful outside the country music charts the song peaked at number 33 on the billboard hot 100 making it the first country song to be a top 40 pop hit since willie nelson and julio iglesias to all the girls ive loved before in early 1984 additionally ill still be loving you reached number three on the adult contemporary chartsreleased third and also reaching number one on the billboard country charts was why does it have to be wrong or right cowritten by randy sharp this song had been rejected from the first album and had originally been rejected from wheels as well due to the band considering it too similar in sound to exile rca executives insisted that the band record the song anyway in order to provide more uptempo material for the album and gregg threatened to quit unless they recorded it this song was a minor adult contemporary hit as well hummingbird the bside of why does it have to be wrong or right was later recorded by ricky skaggs on his 1989 album kentucky thunder and was a top 20 country hit for him in 1990 the fourth and final country single from wheels was the title track which topped the country charts in 1987 this song was written by dave loggins and originally recorded by the bellamy brothers on their 1985 album howard david the bside new york hold her tight accounted for restless hearts third chart entry on billboards adult contemporary chartwheels had favorable critical and commercial reception james m tarbox of knight ridder thought the songs were stronger than those of the debut album highlighting victim of the game and new york hold her tight in particular tom roland of allmusic later wrote that he guys found their niche with this project big overpowering sound heavy backbeats and very tight harmonies are here in the virgin encyclopedia of country music colin larkin noted that ill still be loving you became a popular song for fans to play at their weddings the song was nominated at the 30th annual grammy awards in 1988 in the category of best country performance by a duo or group with vocal this nomination led to the band performing the song on the awards telecast on march 2 1988 wheels was certified gold by the recording industry association of america riaa for shipments of 500000 copies in the united states also during this timespan the band contributed the song dont ask the reason why to the soundtrack of the 1987 movie the secret of my success restless hearts tour schedule at this point included concerts with other rca nashville artists such as alabama juice newton eddie rabbitt and earl thomas conleythe bands third album big dreams in a small town came in 1988 from it came two more number one singles the bluest eyes in texas and a tender lie as well as topfive hits in its title track and say whats in your heart this album was also the first to feature members other than stewart on lead vocals gregg sang el dorado and shared lead vocals with stewart on both carved in stone and the bluest eyes in texas while dittrich sang calm before the storm the band members wrote some of the songs themselves and played all the instruments except for fairlight cmi synthesizers which were programmed by carl marsh and david humphreys dubois cowrote the bluest eyes in texas with van stephenson and dave robbins who would later become members of the country band blackhawk in the early 1990s the band members agreed to record the song because they had not previously recorded a song about the state of texas and thought doing so would be appealing to fans from that state people gave the album a positive review noting the bands musicianship and prominent vocal harmony as well as the considerable amount of passion in their music relative to their contemporaries writing for the miami news mario tarradell praised stewarts conviction on the title track and gentle delivery on the bluest eyes in texas as well as the variety in tempo and arrangement between individual tracks the band supported this album by touring with alabama and the judds both of whom were also on rca at the time the album accounted for the bands second grammy nomination in the category of best country performance by a duo or group with vocal in 1989 while its title track was nominated in the same category a year laterrestless hearts fourth album fast movin train was released in 1990 its title track also written by loggins and dancys dream were topfive hits while when somebody loves you and long lost friend were less successful robert k oermann of the tennessean found this album superior to the ones before it praising the direct approach of the singles lyrics while also noting a roots rock influence in the increased use of acoustic instruments over the preceding albums david j remondini writing for the indianapolis star thought the albums title track had an attractive melody and gripping lyrics also considering the album to have the right balance of tempos and influences of bluegrass music in tracks such as dancys dream tim darragh of the allentown pennsylvania morning call was less favorable criticizing the album for prefab harmonies and formulaic lyrics fast movin train became the bands third gold album in 1991 and the title track accounted for the bands fourth grammy nomination during this timespan stewart sang backing vocals on they just dont make em like you anymore a track from kenny rogers 1991 album back home again a greatest hits package the best of restless heart followed in 1991 it included two new recordings both of which were released as singles you can depend on me was a topfive hit while familiar pain was less successful as dubois had become president of arista nashville by this point his production duties for the new songs were taken over by josh leo the release of this compilation also led to til i loved you being reissued for adult contemporary peaking at number 33 on the billboard chart for that formatlarry stewart left the band in december 1991 because he wanted to perform as a solo artist with a more neotraditional country style as opposed to the bands country pop influence according to the other band members his decision to leave was a surprise at first although the departure was amicable stewart initially remained with rca as a solo artist his debut single alright already reached number five on the country music charts in 1993 and ill cry tomorrow was also a top40 country hit both of these were included on his solo debut album down the road he recorded two albums for columbia records in 1994 and 1996 and while these albums accounted for five more charted singles none were as successfulthe remaining four members decided to rotate lead vocal duties amongst themselves instead of hiring a new lead vocalist as they thought stewart was the most conservative member of the group and that alternating the lead vocal would allow the band to become more adventurous in addition they thought this arrangement was tenable due to their admiration of other bands with more than one lead vocalist such as the eagles chicago and the beatles they first performed without stewart at a concert in grand forks north dakota in early 1992 followed by a series of dates throughout canada to accommodate for stewarts departure the other band members assumed the vocal duties when singing their existing singles in concert innis sang the bluest eyes in texas and fast movin train dittrich sang dancys dream and big dreams in a small town jennings sang a tender lie and gregg sang everything else the only song omitted from their set lists was why does it have to be wrong or right due to it having a more complex vocal arrangement which they felt could not be achieved with only four voicesthe rotation of lead vocal duties continued on restless hearts next album 1992s big iron horses leo once again served as producer and alternated with bruce gaitsch as rhythm guitarist on several songs while bernie leadon contributed on banjo according to the band leo encouraged them to write more songs by themselves than on previous efforts as he thought both this and the absence of stewart would allow the other members to have more fully realized musical personalities than before in particular jennings thought that dittrich being a drummer who also sang was favorably comparable to eagles vocalist and drummer don henley one of the tracks with dittrich on lead vocals when she cries was the albums first single it went to number nine on the country charts number eleven on the hot 100 their highest entry on that chart and number two on the adult contemporary charts additionally it accounted for the bands fifth and final grammy nomination after it came we got the love and mending fences which both fell short of the country top ten dittrich also sang the former while gregg sang the latterinnis also left the band in january 1993 with the other band members citing erratic behavior that resulted in the cancellation of five concerts a month prior as the reason behind his departure jennings also noted that innis wanted to assume a bigger role after stewarts departure and that there were unsubstantiated rumors among the other band members that innis was subject to drug and alcohol abuse in response to inniss departure they hired dwain rowe as touring keyboardist and chris hicks as touring guitarist three months later the band reached the top of the billboard adult contemporary charts as guest vocalists on canadian smooth jazz saxophonist warren hills single tell me what you dreamthe next album 1994s matters of the heart included only gregg jennings and dittrich along with a number of studio musicians among these were keyboardists bill cuomo carl marsh and hawk wolinski as well as upright bass player roy huskey jr and fiddle player stuart duncan the band intentionally sought to make the album more traditionally country than its predecessors due to increasing competition they had faced following the arrival of several new country bands in the early 1990s its only single baby needs new shoes fell short of the top 40 alanna nash of entertainment weekly rated the album c as she thought the tracks sweet whiskey lies and hometown boy were more countrysounding than their previous songs although she considered the arrangements by the book restless heart was one of several country music artists to make a cameo in the 1994 mel gibson film maverick they sang the title track to the movies soundtrack which also featured both them and stewart on a multiartist collaborative rendition of the hymn amazing grace credited to the maverick choirdue to the commercial failure of matters of the heart restless heart was dropped by rca nashville at the end of 1994 in response to this the three remaining band members announced they would go on hiatus in january 1995 stewart jennings dittrich and gregg reunited for one performance in june 1996 which included acoustic renditions of big dreams in a small town the bluest eyes in texas fast movin train and amazing grace this was not considered a formal reunion as the band members had done so to honor the wishes of a terminally ill member of their fan club at the time stewart was continuing to record as a solo artist jennings had joined vince gills road band and gregg was managing a chain of car washes owned by his familyin late 1996 dittrich founded another band called the buffalo club with guitarist charlie kelley and lead vocalist ron hemby a former member of the imperials the buffalo club recorded one album for rising tide records and charted three singles including the top ten if she dont love you in early 1997 this song had previously been offered to restless heart by its cowriter marc beeson who also cowrote when she cries but they had declined to record it dittrich resigned from the buffalo club in august 1997 and the other two members separated by years end according to a former rising tide executive dittrichs departure and the buffalo clubs disbanding were due to dittrich expressing interest in a restless heart reunion tour which created conflict among him the other two band members and label executivesstewart jennings dittrich and gregg reunited to record three new tracks for their second greatesthits compilation in 1998 greatest hits according to stewart this reunion and album were done at the request of rca executives in addition to their previous hit singles the album included the new songs no end to this road for lack of better words and somebodys gon na get that girl the former two of which were issued as singles the band promoted this project the same year by touring with gill before disbanding a second time following this second disbanding stewart released a fourth solo album for windham hill records in 1999other than stewart the individual members of restless heart remained largely inactive until august 2001 when stewart gregg jennings dittrich and innis all officially reunited and began rehearsing together stewart told cmt journalist edward morris that the impetus for their reunion was a telephone call from hendricks who was having lunch with innis at the time at this point stewart and innis had not talked to each other for a number of years owing to the disputes that had led to innis departing the band several years prior stewart then chose to call innis at which point the two resolved and suggested reforming restless heart immediately after their reunion the band resumed touring with one of their first reunion concerts taking place at the french lick resort in french lick indiana in january 2002 they also released a single titled torch of freedom which they performed in 2003 at the larry h miller utah summer gamesafter they had all reunited the five members decided to record a new album as both hendricks and dubois were involved in other projects at the time the band selected a different set of producers one of the producers was kyle lehning best known for his work with randy travis lehning shared duties with mac mcanally a singersongwriter and producer who was also a member of jimmy buffetts coral reefer band the recordings with lehning and mcanally became the bands 2004 album still restless released on the nashville division of koch records now mnrk music group in addition to coproducing mcanally sang background vocals and played guitar piano mandola and the papoose a custommade guitar created by tacoma guitars he also wrote three of the albums songs including down the road which was previously a single for him in 1990 and would later be rereleased in 2008 as a duet between him and kenny chesney dittrich sang another one of mcanallys compositions looking back as well as a cover of the beatless the night before while gregg sang yesterdays news lead single feel my way to you peaked at number 29 on the country music charts and was the albums only single

the united states air force as well as the blue suede dinner and auction a charity event held by the carl perkins center for the prevention of child abuse by 2011 the band was doing over 100 concerts a year restless heart was still primarily a touring band throughout the 2010s and had not released a new album in several years although they thought their existing hit singles were strong enough to be accepted by younger generations of fans as well in 2015 both they and becky hobbs were inducted into the oklahoma music hall of fame one of their few releases in the 2010s was a cover of glen campbells wichita lineman according to the band members they had been encouraged by campbell to record the song after meeting him thirty years ago but had not previously found the time to do soin 2018 stewart began recording with the frontmen a group which also includes richie mcdonald of lonestar and tim rushlow of little texas despite the foundation of this group stewart continued to tour with restless heart at the time a year later restless heart joined the triple threat tour which included blackhawk and shenandoah one of this tours first stops was at montanafair in billings montanarestless heart officially retired in 2021 although little announcement was made of this stewart said that factors in their retirement included disagreements over a proposed album to honor the bands 35th anniversary as well as his own commitments to the frontmen and the start of the covid19 pandemic following their retirement innis moved to waco texas and began various music projects there stewart continued to record with the frontmen who signed a recording contract with bbr music group in mid2023dubois said that he conceived restless heart as a hot instrumental band that could really play well on stage‚Äîthat had great harmony and that he had given them songs that he felt were natural but had been rejected by other artists such as alabama for being too pop he noted that during showcases for radio representatives early in the bands career he was often questioned on the bands ability to duplicate their records live due to them having been assembled in a studio setting however dubois felt that live performances were not an issue due to the band having played and sung everything on their debut album without any additional session musicians or studio vocalists although many of the band members had experience writing songs they allowed songs from dubois or other writers as well jennings said in 1992 that when it comes to choosing tunes the best song winsrestless hearts sound draws influences from mainstream country music as well as from pop and rock because of the bands layered harmonies many critics have drawn comparisons to the eagles sterling whitaker of taste of country describes stewart as having a clear strong tenor stewart said that his affinity for vocal harmony was influenced by the music he listened to as a child which included the jordanaires and various gospel music groups and that the band cited a variety of musicians from buck owens to eric clapton as individual influences he thought that the band members having varied influences outside of country was a factor in their sound a 1985 article in billboard wrote that debut single let the heartache ride introduced the bands razoredged vocal harmonies and scorching instrumentals writing for knight ridder james m tarbox found the bands vocal harmonies comparable to both the eagles and to exile colin larkin in the virgin encyclopedia of country music wrote that the band was continuing with the soft rock sounds and harmonies of the eagles he thought the track wheels had a similar sound and concept to the eagless 1972 debut single take it easy mario tarradell of the miami news noted the bands ability to record both rockers and ballads contrasting the heavy guitar and keyboard action on tracks such as jenny come back and the storm and the uptempo beat of big dreams in a small town while noting tender vocal delivery on tracks such as a tender lie and the bluest eyes in texas reviewing their debut album john wooley of the tulsa world thought the bands harmonies and rock influences were comparable to both the eagles and poco he furthered the comparison to the eagles by noting that both bands performed songs with bittersweet imagery about quicksilver womenbecause of their pop and rock influences the band members initially had doubts as to their success at a time when neotraditional country acts such as randy travis were beginning to gain in popularity stewart later said their doubts about success were assuaged when that rock wont roll became a number one single joe edwards of the associated press noted that the band initially faced resistance due to the lack of traditional country instrumentation such as fiddle and steel guitar or typical country lyrical content such as heartbreak or consumption of alcohol in response to this stewart said he considered lyrics that touch peoples heart more important by comparison gregg stated in june 1994 that due to the crossover success of when she cries and tell me what you dream in the early 1990s some radio station executives in the united states thought the band was attempting to abandon the country format and thus refused to play their later singlesthe band members have noted their influence on subsequent generations of country musicians such as brad paisley and little big town both of whom have covered restless heart songs in concert a cappella country group home free has also cited restless heart as a major influence on their vocal harmonies and the group covered why does it have to be wrong or right in 2019a table indicating the members of restless hearta list of albums
