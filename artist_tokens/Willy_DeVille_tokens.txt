miracle in london with mark knopfler serving as his sideman and producer he said it was mark knopflers wife lourdes who came up with the idea to record miracle she said to him that you dont sing like willy and he doesnt play guitar like you but you really like his stuff so why dont you do an album together storybook love a song from miracle and the theme song of the movie the princess bride was nominated for an academy award in 1987 deville performed the song at that years academy awards telecastknopfler heard storybook love and asked if i knew about this movie he was doing it was a rob reiner film about a princess and a prince the song was about the same subject matter as the film so we submitted it to reiner and he loved it about six or seven months later i was half asleep when the phone rang it was the academy of arts and sciences with the whole spiel i hung up on them they called back and lisa his wife answered the phone she came in to tell me that i was nominated for storybook love its pretty wild its not the grammys — its the academy awards which is different for a musician before i knew it i was performing on the awards show with little richard it was the year of dirty dancing and they wonin 1988 deville relocated from new york city to new orleans where he found a spiritual home i was stunned he said in a 1993 interview i had the feeling that i was going back home it was very strange i live in the french quarter two streets away from bourbon street at night when i go to bed i hear the boogie that comes from the streets and in the morning when i wake up i hear the bluesin 1990 deville made victory mixture a tribute album of classic new orleans soul and rb which he recorded with some of the songs original composers the album was recorded without the use of overdubbing or sound editing with the goal of capturing the spirit of the original recordingsi got all the original guys to come back in like earl king dr john and eddie bo allen toussaint played side piano i brought in the rhythm section of the meters on a couple of cuts we call it the little record its funny because i was just trying to get them money the writers of the songs cause they all got ripped off in the 1950s and 1960s they were all fascinated and dr john who had played on devilles 1978 album return to magenta and who deville knew from his association with doc pomus convinced them that they wouldnt get ripped off by this northern white boy thats when i crossed over to being a local here in new orleans we were all pleased with it its recorded the way it was originally done back then its live with no overdubs anywhere no digital no editing we played the song several times and just picked the best take the one that was the most natural its on fnacorleans records im really proud of that onevictory mixture was recorded for a small independent label orleans records which licensed it to sky ranch fnac music in france it sold over 100000 units in europe very quickly—our first gold disc said carlo ditta founder of orleans records and the producer of victory mixturein the summer of 1992 deville toured europe with dr john johnny adams zachary richard and the wild magnolias as part of his new orleans revue tour the travel buses and planes and the accommodations had to be some of the worst ive ever experienced but the shows themselves were great at the end of each show wed throw mardi gras throws out to the audience you know strands of purple and gold beads and theyd never seen anything like it and they loved itin 1992 deville recorded backstreets of desire the first of four albums he would record in los angeles with producer john philip shenale i say it every time i record in la — that ill never do it again and i keep doing it its crazy i just record and go to the hotel and never go out then back to the studio i hate la its the worst i think they eat their children there i never saw any kids its a pity there arent more studios in new orleans although deville complained about having to record in los angeles recording in that city put him in touch with many talented latino musicians who helped shape his distinctive spanishamericana soundfor backstreets of desire he was joined by david hidalgo of los lobos efrain toro mariachi los camperos and jimmy zavala as well as new orleans musicians dr john and zachary richard and la session musicians jeff baxter freebo jim gilstrap and brian ray allmusic said about the albumwilly devilles backstreets of desire stands tall as his masterpiece as both a singer and a songwriter devilles considerable reputation in paris buoyed him up to make this disc with guest spots by dr john zachary richard and david hidalgo deville creates a tapestry of roots rock and crescent city second line traces of 1950s doowop and elegant sweeping vistas of spanish soul balladry combined with lyrics full of busteddown heroes hungry lovers and wise men trying to get off the street the sound of the album balances creole soul and pure rock pyrotechnics deville sounds like a man resurrected digging as deep as the cavernous recesses of the human heartbackstreets of desire included a novel mariachi version of the jimi hendrix standard hey joe that was a hit in europe rising to number one in spain and france deville said about hey joe the song originally comes from the texasmexico border area hey call it texico i tried instead of doing something that sounded like jimi hendrix that would have been a cliché i tried to take the song back to the way that it must originally have sounded which would be with mariachis its classic but its classic with a little twist a little different i put a bit of pachuco canal street slang talking i added a couple of verses of my own backstreets of desire was released in the united states in 1994 on rhino records forward labelin 1984 deville married his second wife lisa leggett who proved to be an astute business manager on the strength of his success touring and selling albums in europe they bought a horse farm casa de sueños in picayune mississippi and began living there as well as at their apartment and studio in the french quarter of new orleans deville told an interviewer in 1996 i finally got the plantation i just bought this house and 11 acres 45 ha it looks a little bit like graceland i got into horses since

in a pear treedeville did not have a recording contract with an american label in the mid1990s his next two albums willy deville live 1993 and big easy fantasy 1995 were recorded for fnac music a french label willy deville live was a number one record in spain big easy fantasy presents live recordings of the mink deville band playing with new orleans legends eddie bo and the wild magnolias and remixes from the victory mixture sessionsdeville said i was pissed off and i didnt have a record deal for a few years at the time i didnt want one i was getting very gunshy about labels i was performing in europe and i was doing great without one when you get to that stage in your mind they all start coming around its pretty strange the way that happensin 1995 he returned to los angeles to record loup garou again with producer john philip shenale musician said about the album loup garou is subtle in nuance but staggering in scope it connects the dots between all of the artists sacrosanct influences often within the framework of a single song all of it is on the money performed from the heart loup garou featured a duet with brenda lee deville said she didnt know who the hell i was i just called her up played the song for her and she loved it she had her business people check me out and they reported that i was big in europe and had been recording for twenty years so i flew to nashville thats got to go down in my book as one of the most memorable experiences in my careerthe cover of loup garou showed deville in turn of the 20th century new orleans garb posing on a street corner in new orleans french quarter it included voodoo chants and a song subtitled vampires lullaby the singer had completely immersed himself in new orleans culture percussionist boris kinberg a longtime member of the mink deville band said about the stages of willy devilles careerto my mind there were three main eras the first era was the lower east side skinny tie purple shirt west side story puerto rican sharks gang vibe then it transmuted into the mississippi plantationgambler riverboat rogue the rhett butler thing where he had had custommade suits and really got into the period and the clothes and just totally immersed himself in new orleans not the present new orleans but the new orleans of the 1880s and 1890s—the absinthedrinking voodoo new orleans he totally immersed himself in that then he left new orleans and moved to the southwest and came back as the second coming of black elkbefore moving to the southwest in 2000 deville recorded horse of a different color in memphis the 1999 album produced by jim dickinson includes a chaingang song a cover of fred mcdowells going over the hill and a cover of andre williamss bacon fat allmusic said about the album simply put no one has this range or depth in interpreting not only styles but also the poetics of virtually any set of lyrics deville makes everything he sings believable horse of a different color is the most consistent and brilliant recording of willy devilles long career horse of a different color was the first willy deville album since 1987s miracle to be released simultaneously in europe and

records when im dead it isnt very pleasant but i have to get used to this ideajack nitzsche said that deville was the best singer he had ever worked withcritic robert palmer wrote about him in 1980 mr deville is a magnetic performer but his macho stage presence camouflages an acute musical intelligence his songs and arrangements are rich in ethnic rhythms and blues echoes the most disparate stylistic references yet they flow seamlessly and hang together solidly he embodies new yorks tangle of cultural contradictions while making music thats both idiomatic in the broadest sense and utterly originalin a 2015 interview bob dylan suggested deville should be in the rock and roll hall of fame said dylan deville stood out his voice and presentation ought to have gotten him in there by nowcritic thom jurek said about him his catalog is more diverse than virtually any other modern performer the genre span of the songs hes written is staggering from early rock and rhythm and blues styles to deltastyled blues from cajun music to new orleans second line from latintinged folk to punky salseros to elegant orchestral ballads—few people could write a love song like deville he was the embodiment of rock and rolls romance its theater its style its drama camp and dangerhis sometime collaborator mark knopfler said of deville willy had an enormous range the songs he wrote were original romantic and straight from the heartthom jurek wrote about him after his death willy deville is americas loss even if america doesnt know it yet the reason is simple like the very best rock and roll writers and performers in our history hes one of the very few who got it right he understood what made a threeminute song great and why it mattered—because it mattered to him he lived and died with the audience in his shows and he gave them something to remember when they left the theater because he meant every single word of every song as he performed it europeans like that in this jingoistic age of american pride perhaps we can revisit our own true love of rock and roll by discovering willy deville for the first time—or at the very least remember him for what he really was an american original the mythos and pathos in his songs his voice and his performances were born in these streets and cities and then given to the world who appreciated him much more than we didsinger peter wolf of the j geils band said about him he had all the roots of music that i love and had this whole street thing of rb – just the whole gestalt he was just a tremendous talent a true artist in the sense

live 2011 marc meyers declared there was creative heat and pain in mr devilles eerie edgy look and sound while his punkroadhouse fusion sailed over the heads of many at home his approach inspired many british pop invaders of the 1980s including tears for fears human league and culture club he was a punk eclectic with a heart of golden oldies and joe cockers pipes a seedy sophisticate mr deville was decades ahead of his timein 2022 the documentary heaven stood still the incarnations of willy deville was released portraying his life and music directed by larry locke and featuring willy deville
