the backing group for torontobased rockabilly singer ronnie hawkins levon helm began playing with the group in 1957 then became their fulltime drummer after graduating from high school in 1958 helm journeyed with hawkins from arkansas to ontario where they were joined by robbie robertson rick danko richard manuel and finally garth hudson latterday band member stan szelest was also in the group at that time hawkinss act was popular in and around toronto and nearby hamilton and he had an effective way of eliminating his musical competition when a promising band appeared hawkins would hire their best musicians for his own group robertson danko and manuel came under hawkinss tutelage this waywhile most of the hawks were eager to join hawkinss group getting hudson to join was more difficult having earned a college degree hudson planned on a career as a music teacher and was only interested in playing rock music only as a hobby the hawks admired his wild fullbore organ style and asked him repeatedly to join hudson finally agreed under the condition that the hawks each pay him 10 per week to be their instructor and purchase a new stateoftheart lowrey organ all music theory questions were directed to hudsonthere is a view that jazz is evil because it comes from evil people but actually the greatest priests on 52nd street and on the streets of new york city were the musicians they were doing the greatest healing work and they knew how to punch through music which would cure and make people feel good—garth hudson in the last waltzwith hawkins they recorded a few singles in this period and became well known as the best rock group in the thriving toronto music scene hawkins regularly convened allnight rehearsals following long club shows with the result that the young musicians quickly developed great technical prowess on their instrumentsin late 1963 the group split from hawkins over personal differences they had grown tired of playing the same songs so often and wanted to perform original material and they were also wary of hawkinss heavyhanded leadership he would fine the hawks if they brought their girlfriends to the clubs fearing it might reduce the numbers of available girls who came to performances or if they smoked marijuanarobertson later said eventually built us up to the point where we outgrew his music and had to leave he shot himself in the foot really by sharpening us into such a crackerjack band that we had to go on out into the world because we knew what his vision was for himself and we were all younger and more ambitious musicallyupon leaving hawkins the group was briefly known as the levon helm sextet with a sixth member saxophonist jerry penfound and then as levon and the hawks after penfounds departure in 1965 they released a single on ware records under the name the canadian squires but they returned as levon and the hawks for a recording session for atco later that year also in 1965 helm and the band met blues singer and harmonica player sonny boy williamson they wanted to record with him offering to become his backing band but williamson died not long after their meetinglater in 1965 american musician bob dylan hired the group as his backing band for his us tour in 1965 and world tour in 1966 following the 1966 tour the group moved with help from dylan and his manager albert grossman to saugerties new york where they made the informal 1967 recordings that became the basement tapes the basis for their 1968 debut album music from big pink because they were always referred to simply as the band to various frontmen and the locals in woodstock helm said the name the band worked well when the group came into its own the group decided on it as their official name began performing as under it in from 1968 onward dylan continued to collaborate with the band over the course of their career most notably in a joint 1974 tourin late summer 1965 bob dylan was looking for a backup band for his first us electric tour levon and the hawks were recommended by blues singer john p hammond who earlier that year had recorded with helm hudson and robertson on his vanguard album so many roads around the same time one of their friends from toronto mary martin was working as secretary to dylans manager albert grossman she told dylan to visit the group at le coq dor tavern a club on yonge street in toronto—though robertson recollects it was the friars tavern just down the street her advice to dylan you got ta see these guysafter hearing the band play and meeting with robertson dylan invited helm and robertson to join his backing band after two concerts backing dylan helm and robertson told dylan of their loyalty to their bandmates and told him that they would continue with him only if he hired all of the hawks dylan accepted and invited levon and the hawks to tour with him the group was receptive to the offer knowing it could give them the wider exposure they craved they thought of themselves as a tightly rehearsed rock and rhythm and blues group and knew dylan mostly from his early acoustic folk and protest music furthermore they had little inkling of how internationally popular dylan had becomewith dylan the hawks played a series of concerts from september 1965 through may 1966 billed as bob dylan and the band the tours were marked by dylans reportedly copious use of amphetamines some though not all of the hawks joined in the excesses most of the concerts were met with heckling and disapproval from folk music purists helm was so affected by the negative reception that he left the tour after a little more than one month and sat out the rest of that years concerts as well as the world tour in 1966 helm spent much of this period working on an oil rig in the gulf of mexicoduring and between tours dylan and the hawks attempted several recording sessions but with less than satisfying results sessions in october and november yielded just one usable single can you please crawl out your window and two days of recording in january 1966 for what was intended to be dylans next album blonde on blonde resulted in one of us must know sooner or later which was released as a single a few weeks later and was subsequently selected for the album on one of us must know dylan was backed by drummer bobby gregg bassist danko or bill lee guitarist robbie robertson pianist paul griffin and al kooper who was more a guitarist than an organist playing organ frustrated by the slow progress in the new york studio dylan accepted the suggestion of producer bob johnston and moved the recording sessions to nashville in nashville robertsons guitar was prominent on the blonde on blonde recordings especially in the song leopardskin pillbox hat but the other members of the hawks did not attend the sessionsduring the european leg of their 1966 world tour mickey jones replaced sandy konikoff on drums dylan and the hawks played at the free trade hall in manchester on may 17 1966 the gig became legendary when near the end of dylans electric set an audience member shouted judas after a pause dylan replied i dont believe you youre a liar he then turned to the hawks and said play it fucking loud with that they launched into an acidic version of like a rolling stonethe manchester performance was widely bootlegged and mistakenly placed at the royal albert hall in a 1971 review for creem critic dave marsh wrote my response is that crystallization of everything that is rocknroll music at its finest was to allow my jaw to drop my body to move to leap out of the chair it is an experience that one desires simply to share to play over and over again for those he knows thirst for such pleasure if i speak in an almost worshipful sense about this music it is not because i have lost perspective it is precisely because i have found it within music yes that was made five years ago but it is there and unignorable when the concert finally saw an official release as the bootleg series vol 4 bob dylan live 1966 the royal albert hall concert in 1998 critic richie unterberger declared the record an important document of rock historyon july 29 1966 while on a break from touring dylan was injured in a motorcycle accident that precipitated his retreat into semiseclusion in woodstock new york for a while the hawks returned to the bar and roadhouse touring circuit sometimes backing other singers including a brief stint with tiny tim dylan invited the hawks to join him in woodstock in february 1967 and danko hudson and manuel rented a large pink house which they named big pink in nearby west saugerties new york the next month initially without helm they commenced recording a muchbootlegged and influential series of demos initially at dylans house in woodstock and later at big pink which were released partially on lp as the basement tapes in 1975 and in full in 2014 a trackbytrack review of the bootleg was detailed by jann wenner in rolling stone in which the band members were explicitly named and given the collective name the crackers while helm was not involved in the initial recording he did perform in later sessions and in overdubs recorded in 1975 before the albums releasethe sessions with dylan ended in october 1967 with helm having rejoined the group by that time and the hawks began writing their own songs at big pink when they went into the recording studio they still did not have a name for themselves stories vary as to the manner in which they ultimately adopted the name the band in the last waltz manuel claimed that they wanted to call themselves either the honkies or the crackers which they used when backing dylan for a january 1968 concert tribute to woody guthrie but these names were vetoed by their record label robertson suggests that during their time with dylan everyone just referred to them as the band and the name stuck initially they disliked the moniker but eventually they grew to like it thinking it both humble and presumptuous in 1969 rolling stone referred to them as the band from big pinktheir debut album music from big pink was released in july 1968 and was widely acclaimed it included three songs written or cowritten by dylan this wheels on fire tears of rage and i shall be released as well as the weight which became one of their bestknown songs after it was used in the 1969 film easy rider while a thematic continuity ran through the music the musical style varied from song to songin early 1969 after the success of music from big pink the band went on tour starting with an appearance at winterland ballroom they performed at the woodstock festival their performance was not included in the famed woodstock film because of legal complications and later that year they performed with dylan at the uk isle of wight festival several songs from which were subsequently included on dylans self portrait album that same year they left for los angeles to record their followup the band 1969 from their rustic appearance on the cover to the songs and arrangements within the album stood in contrast to other popular music of the day several other artists made similar stylistic moves about the same time notably dylan on john wesley harding which was written during the basement tapes sessions and the byrds on sweetheart of the rodeo which featured two basement tapes covers the band featured songs that evoked oldtime rural america from the civil war in the night they drove old dixie down to the unionization of farm workers in king harvest has surely comethese first two records were produced by john simon who was practically a group member he aided in arrangements in addition to playing occasional piano and tuba simon reported that he was often asked about the distinctive horn sections featured so effectively on the first two albums people wanted to know how they had achieved such memorable sounds simon stated that besides hudson an accomplished saxophonist the others had only rudimentary horn skills and achieved their sound simply by creatively using their limited techniquerolling stone lavished praise on the band in this era giving them more attention than perhaps any other group in the magazines history greil marcuss articles contributed to the bands mystique the band was also featured on the cover of time january 12 1970 the first rock group after the beatles over two years earlier to achieve this rare distinction david atties unused photographs for this cover—among the very few studio portraits taken during the bands prime—have only recently been discovered and were featured in daniel rohers robbie robertson documentary once were brothers robbie robertson and the band as well as having their own fourpage spread in harvey kubernik and ken kuberniks “ the story of the band from big pink to the last waltz ” sterling publishing 2018a critical and commercial triumph the band along with works by the byrds and the flying burrito brothers established a musical template dubbed country rock that paved the way to the eagles both big pink and the band also influenced their musical contemporaries eric clapton and george harrison cited the band as a major influence on their musical direction in the late 1960s and early 1970s clapton later revealed that he wanted to join the group while he never did join he recruited all of the members of the band as well as other roots rock performers for his 1976 album no reason to cryfollowing their second album the band embarked on their first tour as a lead act the anxiety of fame was clear as the groups songs turned to darker themes of fear and alienation the influence on their next work is selfexplanatory stage fright 1970 was engineered by musicianengineerproducer todd rundgren and recorded on stage at the iconic woodstock playhouse as with their previous selftitled record robertson was credited with most of the songwriting initial critical reaction was positive but it was seen as a disappointment from the previous two albums for various reasons after recording stage fright the band was among the acts participating in the festival express an allstar rock concert tour of canada by train that also included janis joplin the grateful dead and future band member richard bell at the time he was a member of joplins band in the concert documentary film released in 2003 danko can be seen participating in a drunken jam session with jerry garcia bob weir john dawson and joplin while singing aint no more caneat about this time robertson began exerting greater control over the band a point of contention between him and helm helm charges robertson with authoritarianism and greed while robertson suggests his increased efforts in guiding the group were largely because danko helm and manuel were becoming more unreliable due to their heroin usage robertson insists he did his best to coax manuel into writing more songs only to see him descend into addictiondespite mounting problems among the group members the band forged ahead with their next album cahoots 1971 cahoots featured dylans when i paint my masterpiece 4 pantomime with van morrison and life is a carnival the last featuring a horn arrangement by allen toussaint toussaints contribution was a critical addition to the bands next project and the group would later record two songs written by toussaint holy cow on moondog matinee and you see me on jubilation in late december 1971 the band recorded the live album rock of ages which was released in the summer of 1972 on rock of ages they were bolstered by the addition of a horn section with arrangements written by toussaint dylan appeared on stage on new years eve and performed four songs with the group including a version of when i paint my masterpiecein 1973 the band released the covers album moondog matinee there was no tour in support of the album which garnered mixed reviews however on

600000 fans also featured the grateful dead and the allman brothers band it was during this event that discussions began about a possible tour with bob dylan who had moved to malibu california along with robertson by late 1973 danko helm hudson and manuel had joined them and the first order of business was backing dylan on his album planet waves the album was released concurrently with their joint 1974 tour in which they played 40 shows in north america during january and february 1974 later that year the tour was documented on the live album before the floodduring this time the band brought in planet waves producer rob fraboni to help design a music studio for the group by 1975 the studio shangrila was completed that year the band recorded and released northern lights – southern cross their first album of allnew material since 1971 all eight songs were written solely by robertson despite comparatively poor record sales the album is favored by critics and fans levon helm regards this album highly in his book this wheels on fire it was the best album we had done since the band the album also produced more experimentation from hudson switching to synthesizers showcased on jupiter hollowby the mid1970s robbie robertson was weary of touring after northern lights – southern cross failed to meet commercial expectations much of the groups 1976 tour was confined to theaters and smaller arenas in secondary markets including the santa cruz civic auditorium the long island arena and the champlain valley expo in essex junction vermont culminating in an opening slot for the ascendant zz top at the nashville fairgrounds in september in early september richard manuel suffered a severe neck injury in a boating accident in texas prompting robertson to urge the band

case that it had been primarily robbie robertsons project and that robertson had forced the bands breakup on the rest of the group robertson offered a different take in a 1986 interview i made my big statement i did the movie i made a threerecord album about it—and if this is only my statement not theirs ill accept that theyre saying well that was really his trip not our trip well fine ill take

vocals and drumming on several tracks manuel later worked on several film scores with hudson and robertson including raging bull and the color of money whispering pines live at the getaway was released in 2002the bands music fused many elements although primarily incorporating old country music and early rock and roll the rhythm section often was reminiscent of stax or motownstyle rhythm and blues and robertson cites curtis mayfield and the staple singers as major influences resulting in a synthesis of many musical genres singers manuel danko and helm each brought a distinctive voice to the band helms southern accent was prevalent in his raw and powerful vocals danko sang tenor with a distinctively choppy enunciation and manuel alternated between falsetto and a soulful baritone the singers regularly blended in harmonies though the singing was more or less evenly shared among the three both danko and helm have stated that they saw manuel as the bands lead singerevery member was a multiinstrumentalist there was little instrumentswitching when they played live but when recording the musicians could make up different configurations in service of the songs hudson in particular was able to coax a wide range of timbres from his lowrey organ helms drumming was often praised critic jon carroll declared that helm was the only drummer who can make you cry while prolific session drummer jim keltner admits to appropriating several of helms techniques producer john simon is often cited as a sixth member of the band for producing and playing on music from big pink coproducing and playing on the band and playing on other songs up through the bands 1993 reunion album jerichorobertson is credited as writer or cowriter of the majority of the bands songs and as a result has received most of the songwriting royalties generated from the music this would become a point of contention especially for helm in his 1993 autobiography this wheels on fire levon helm and the story of the band helm disputed the validity of the songwriting credits as listed on the albums and explained that the bands songs were developed in collaboration with all members danko concurred with helm i think levons book hits the nail on the head about where robbie and albert grossman and some of those people went wrong and when the band stopped being the band im truly friends with everybody but hey—it could happen to levon too when people take themselves too seriously and believe too much in their own bullshit they usually get in trouble robertson denied that helm had written any of the songs attributed to robertson the studio albums recorded by levon helm as a solo artist—levon helm 1978 american son levon helm 1982 dirt farmer and electric dirt—contain only one song crediting him as songwriter growin trade cowritten with larry campbellthe band has influenced numerous bands songwriters and performers including the grateful dead eric clapton george harrison crosby stills nash young led zeppelin elvis costello elton john phish and pink floyd the album music from big pink in particular is credited with contributing to claptons decision to leave the supergroup cream in his introduction of the band during the bob dylan 30th anniversary concert clapton announced that in 1968 he had heard the album and it changed my life the band nazareth took their name from a line in the weight guitarist richard thompson has acknowledged the albums influence on fairport conventions liege and lief and journalist john harris has suggested that the bands debut also influenced the spirit of the beatles backtobasics album let it be as well as the rolling stones string of rootsinfused albums that began with beggars banquet george harrison said that his song all things must pass was heavily influenced by the band and that while writing the song he imagined levon helm singing it meanwhile the weight has been covered numerous times and in various musical styles in a 1969 interview robbie robertson remarked on the groups influence we certainly didnt want everybody to go out and get a banjo and a fiddle player we were trying to calm things down a bit though what were going to do now is go to muscle shoals alabama and record four sides four psychedelic songs total freakme songs just to show that we have no hard feelings just pretty good rock and rollin the 1990s a new generation of bands influenced by the band began to gain popularity including counting crows the wallflowers and the black crowes counting crows indicated this influence with their tribute to the late richard manuel if i could give all my love richard manuel is dead from their album hard candy the black crowes frequently cover songs by the band during live performances such as the night they drove old dixie down which appears on their dvdcd freak n roll into the fog they have also recorded at helms studio in woodstockthe inspiration for the classic rockinfluenced
