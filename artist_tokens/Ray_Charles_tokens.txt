at the time during his atlantic years charles had been hailed for his inventive compositions but by the time of the release of the largely instrumental jazz album genius soul jazz 1960 for abcs subsidiary label impulse he had given up on writing in favor of becoming a cover artist giving his own eclectic arrangements of existing songswith georgia on my mind his first hit single for abcparamount in 1960 charles received national acclaim and four grammy awards including two for georgia on my mind best vocal performance single record or track male and best performance by a pop single artist written by stuart gorrell and hoagy carmichael the song was charles first work with sid feller who produced arranged and conducted the recording charles rendition of the tune helped elevate it to the status of an american classic and his version also became the state song of georgia in 1979charles earned another grammy for the followup track hit the road jack written by rb singer percy mayfieldby late 1961 charles had expanded his small road ensemble to a big band partly as a response to increasing royalties and touring fees becoming one of the few black artists to cross over into mainstream pop with such a level of creative control this success however came to a momentary halt during a concert tour in november 1961 when a police search of charles hotel room in indianapolis indiana led to the discovery of heroin in the medicine cabinet the case was eventually dropped as the search lacked a proper warrant by the police and charles soon returned to musicin the early 1960s on the way from louisiana to oklahoma city charles faced a neardeath experience when the pilot of his plane lost visibility as snow and his failure to use the defroster caused the windshield of the plane to become completely covered in ice the pilot made a few circles in the air before he was finally able to see through a small part of the windshield and land the plane charles placed a spiritual interpretation on the experience claiming that something or someone which instruments can not detect was responsible for creating the small opening in the ice on the windshield which enabled the pilot to eventually land the plane safelythe 1962 album modern sounds in country and western music and its sequel modern sounds in country and western music vol 2 helped to bring

had a toptwenty hit with another ballad here we go againcharles renewed chart success however proved to be short lived and by the 1970s his music was rarely played on radio stations the rise of psychedelic rock and harder forms of rock and rb music had reduced charles radio appeal as did his choosing to record pop standards and covers of contemporary rock and soul hits since his earnings from owning his master tapes had taken away the motivation to write new material charles nonetheless continued to have an active recording career most of his recordings between 1968 and 1973 evoked strong reactions either adored or panned by fans and critics alike his recordings during this period especially 1972s a message from the people moved toward the progressive soul sound popular at the time a message from the people included his unique gospelinfluenced version of america the beautiful and a number of protest songs about poverty and civil rights charles was often criticized for his

recognizable voices in american music in the words of musicologist henry pleasantssinatra and bing crosby before him had been masters of words ray charles is a master of sounds his records disclose an extraordinary assortment of slurs glides turns shrieks wails breaks shouts screams and hollers all wonderfully controlled disciplined by inspired musicianship and harnessed to ingenious subtleties of harmony dynamics and rhythm it is either the singing of a man whose vocabulary is inadequate to express what is in his heart and mind or of one whose feelings are too intense for satisfactory verbal or conventionally melodic articulation he cant tell it to you he cant even sing it to you he has to cry out to you or shout to you in tones eloquent of despair—or exaltation the voice alone with little assistance from the text or the notated music conveys the messagepleasants continues ray charles is usually described as a baritone and his speaking voice would suggest as much as would the difficulty he experiences in reaching and sustaining the baritones high e and f in a popular ballad but the voice undergoes some sort of transfiguration under stress and in music of gospel or blues character he can and does sing for measures on end in the high tenor range of a b flat b c and even c sharp and d sometimes in full voice sometimes in an ecstatic head voice sometimes in falsetto in falsetto he continues up to e and f above high c on one extraordinary record im going down to the riverhe hits an incredible b flatgiving him an overall range including the falsetto extension of at least three octaveshis style and success in the genres of rhythm and blues and jazz had an influence on a number of highly successful artists including as jon pareles has noted elvis presley aretha franklin stevie wonder van morrison and billy joel other singers who have acknowledged charles influence on their own styles include james booker steve winwood richard manuel and gregg allman
