jackson mississippi they immediately began touring throughout the miami area primarily at venues that typically booked rock bands this was because the band wanted to perform original songs while most

music malo wrote every song on the albumdue to the independent albums success throughout the miami music community the band was invited to perform for a showcase in nashville tennessee at which talent

of earlier concert recordings and released only in canada in 1997 during this hiatus malo performed solo shows throughout nashville these focused on pop standards from the 1930s to the 1950s accompanying him at these shows was a ninepiece band assembled by session musician dennis burnside in may 1997 malo also previewed new songs at live sessions from the bluebird café a venue in nashville which is frequented by songwriters accompanying him was jaime hanna son of nitty gritty dirt band founder jeff hanna jaime hanna would also go on to tour with the mavericks as a backup musician the bands hiatus ended in early 1998 with the release of their next studio album trampoline contributing songwriters to trampoline once again included malo kostas house and anderson another

include any overdubbing after the albums release the band toured throughout scandinavia in supportwriting for entertainment weekly scott schnider described malos singing voice favorably also noting influences of samba and soul music in the albums tracks john d buchanan of allmusic wrote that easily the groups most musically ambitious set to date trampolines blend of pop and latin textures didnt connect with the mainstream country audience in the united states the album charted only two singles in the united states to be with you and dance the night away neither reaching top 40 on hot country songs the latter was more successful in the united kingdom reaching number four on the uk singles chart in 1998 its success led to two more singles charting in that country ive got this feeling and someone should tell her dance the night away was also the bands fifth and final grammy award nomination for best country performance by a duo or group with vocal following this albums failure in the united states the mavericks left mca nashville in 1999 deakin told the website country standard time in 2000 that the band chose to leave mca in favor of mercury records because many of the executives who had supported the band during their commercial peak earlier in the decade were no longer active at the label malo told the same publication in 2003 thats part of the problem of being signed to a major label in nashville when you venture outside the box youre pretty much sealing your fatethe bands only release for mercury was a greatest hits compilation called super colossal smash hits of the 90s the best of the mavericks they chose to release a greatesthits album due to their recognition in europe where they found that such compilations tended to be commercially successful for this project each band member selected both singles and album cuts along with four previously unreleased songs among the new songs were covers of buck owens think of me and cat stevens here comes my baby the latter released as a single super colossal smash hits of the 90s was certified gold in the united kingdom by the british phonographic industry bpi for sales of 100000 copies despite the commercial success in other countries the band continued to find lessened success in the united states also in 1999 reynolds divorced yearwood she would marry garth brooks in 2005 by the end of the decade the mavericks had disbanded buchanan said that the band was at loggerheads with their record company malo stated at the time that the decision to disband was due to creative exhaustion brought on by extensive touring combined with unspecified disputes between kane and the rest of the bandafter the disbanding kane released a solo album of cover songs in 2000 titled songs in the key of e malo recorded both as a solo artist and as a member of los super seven a supergroup that also included mexicanamerican country singers rick trevino and freddy fender meanwhile reynolds recorded one album with the supergroup swag which also included members of cheap trick wilco and sixpence none the richer in 2000 mcfadden joined trent summar the new row mobthe mavericks reunited in 2003 with eddie perez as their fourth guitarist malo had known perez because the two had played in an austin texas nightclub prior to the mavericks foundation the reestablished band recorded two albums for the british sanctuary records the selftitled the mavericks and a live album recorded in austin texas which was accompanied by a dvd release malo said that many of the songs on the selftitled album were inspired by his concerns over the sociopolitical scene of the united states following the september 11 attacks and that sanctuary records executives were more willing to let the band record their music without executive interference only one single from the mavericks charted a cover of the hollies the air that i breathe also included on the album was a collaboration with willie nelson on time goes by jeffrey b remz of country standard time reviewed the album favorably finding influences of the beatles and roy orbison in the songwriting and arrangements despite touring in 2003 and 2004 to support these projects they were commercially unsuccessful and the band broke up a second time malo continued to record as a solo artist after this second disbanding he also produced rick trevinos 2003 album in my dreams and wrote several of its songs with hanna after this hanna recorded one album in 2005 as half of the duo hannamceuen while perez briefly toured as dwight yoakams guitarist

album for valory in time was released on february 26 2013 on this project malo coproduced with niko bolas and wrote or cowrote every song writing for allmusic steve leggett stated that it was a further step away from anything resembling a mainstream country release incorporating not only the texmex and cuban influences the band was known for but also the rhythms of polkas tangos and all manner of approaches he thought that these additional influences made the album an extension of their previous efforts following this album the band announced in early 2014 that they would honor their 25th anniversary with a tour throughout the united states and canada starting in charleston south carolinafor live shows reynolds moved from playing playing bass guitar to acoustic guitar ed friedland

abrams saxophone percussion matt cappy trumpet and michael guerra accordion reynolds was fired from the band in october 2014 after the other members learned that he was soliciting money from fans under false pretenses in order to support his addiction his firing left malo and deakin as the two remaining original members the band did not publicize reynoldss departure or the reasons behind it until december reynolds was not replaced by a permanent band member ed friedland continued as a touring bassist and session player on mavericks recordings until 2023the mavericks released their second valory album mono on february 7 2015 the album was so named because it was mixed in monaural sound as with the previous album malo wrote most of the songs except for a cover of doug sahms nitty gritty country standard time reviewer andy turner stated that the album is quite festive and certainly sounds like a band happy to be back and having a fun time a year later this album was nominated at the 58th annual grammy awards for grammy award for best americana albumafter being released from valory in 2016 the band founded their own label mono mundo in association with thirty tigers their first release on their own label was a live album titled all night live volume 1 this was followed by their next studio release brand new day in march 2017 this too was nominated for grammy award for best americana album the following year deming contrasted the album favorably to trampoline noting that the band continued to include latin tejano and vintage pop this was followed in 2018 by their first christmas album hey merry christmas a thirtiethanniversary tour followed in 2019 focusing mainly on the united kingdom canada and the netherlands while also including select locations in the united states by this point both lorenzo molina and julio diaz replaced matt cappy on trumpets coinciding with this tour the band released their next album play the hits the same year this album consisted entirely of cover songs including bruce springsteens hungry heart elvis presleys dont be cruel willie nelsons blue eyes crying in the rain and freddy fenders before the next teardrop falls among others deming said of this album that even when the mavericks dont necessarily make the songs their own they know how to perform them with a conviction that elevates them from the work of another cover outfiton august 21 2020 the band released en español their first album entirely in the spanish language deming stated in allmusic that while the album contained fewer country and pop influences than its predecessors it also emphasized the bands latin music roots more fully than previous projects he concluded his review by stating that it was adventurous and crafted with heart and skill and thats what theyve always done bestfriedland left their touring band in 2023 at which point malo briefly took over on bass in addition to his role as lead singer the band announced their next album moon stars would be released in may 2024 the announcement confirmed that the project would include a collaboration with maggie rose as well as a song cowritten by bernie taupin prior to its release the band went on a tour of europeon june 27 2024 malo announced via social media that he had been diagnosed with intestinal cancer because of treatments the band had to cancel several shows throughout the latter half of 2024 also by this point malo reverted to guitarist when scotty huff joined their touring band as bassistat the time of their signing with mca the mavericks were seen as unusual in country music due not only to malos cubanamerican ancestry but also to the bands origins in miami florida this was because at the time the miami music scene was better known for hip hop music and dance music than for country many reviewers have considered malos role as lead singer and songwriter an integral part of the bands sound in a review of from hell to paradise alanna nash described malos singing voice as a tight pinched vibrato that carries all the tension of a highvoltage wire writing for allmusic john d buchanan described what a crying shame as a grand showcase for the rich emotive vocals of raul malo and the bands eclectic but accessible approach in a review of trampoline for the same site thom owens stated that malos voice was the defining characteristic of the bands sound he wrote that through his singing and production malo was the driving force behind all of the groups stylistic fusions their blend of honky tonk with countryrock classic rock roll pop and latin of the songwriting owens continued that malo was among the most imaginative roots songwriting of the 90s tony brown a record producer who was also the head of artists and repertoire ar of mca nashville at the time of the bands signing described malo as bigger than life in a way that he compared to alabama lead singer randy owen brown also thought that having a great frontman was key to a country music bands successmusic critics have defined the bands musical styles with a wide variety of influences brown thought that the success of new bands in the 1990s such as diamond rio combined with the commercial appeal of more rockinfluenced country bands such as the kentucky headhunters would lead to the mavericks success nash wrote that they constitute country ’ s coolest ensemble synthesizing ’ 50s country and ’ 60s pop and rock with intelligence verve and cultural variety john d buchanan of allmusic said of the band that fusing traditional country with a rich variety of rock pop and latin influences the mavericks became one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups of the early 90s rick bell of the north county times in a review of trampoline noted that the bands use of horn sections and string sections on the album gave it a fuller sound that complemented malos velvety baritone mark deming highlighted nick kanes fine hipster jazz picking in a review of music for all occasions he also found influences of twostep in the albums the writing on the wall and tejano music through the use of accordion on all you ever do is bring me down while joel bernstein of country standard time compared the latter to cajun music for the same reason he also described the bands cover of blue moon as roy orbison meets dean martin deming stated in a review of what a crying shame that robert reynolds and paul deakin are a rhythm section who can give these songs the nervy drive of a rock band without betraying the mavericks country leanings and they give
