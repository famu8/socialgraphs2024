two hit singles memphis and wham in them mack using topquality technique and pristine phrasing added edgy aggressive loud and fast melodies and runs to the predominant chordsandriffs pattern of early rock guitar these tracks raised the bar for rock guitar proficiency helped launch the electric guitar to the top of soloing instruments in rock and served as prototypes for the lead guitar styles of blues rock and southern rock that soon followedshortly after the albums release however the british invasion hit american shores and macks recording career withered on the vine he regularly toured small venues until 1968 when rolling stone magazine rediscovered him and elektra records signed him to a threealbum contract he was soon performing in major venues but his multigenre elektra albums downplayed his lead guitar and blues rock appeal and record sales were modest during this period he became increasingly unhappy with the music business he left elektra in 1971 and for the next fourteen years he functioned as a lowprofile multigenre recording artist roadhouse performer sideman and musicvenue proprietorin 1985 mack resurfaced with a successful blues rock lp strike like lightning a promotional tour featuring celebrity guitarist sitins and a carnegie hall concert with roy buchanan and albert collins in 1986 he went on the greatamerican guitar assault tour with

black gospel musiche began playing guitar at the age of seven after trading his bicycle for a lone ranger model acoustic guitar his mother taught him basic chords and he was soon playing bluegrass guitar in the family band mack recalled that when he was seven or eight years old an uncle from texas introduced him to blues guitar and that when he was about ten years of age an old black man named wayne clark introduced him to robert johnson style guitar he soon taught himself to merge fingerpicking country guitar with acoustic bluespicking to produce a hybrid style which mack said sounded like rockabilly but before rockabillyhis musical influences remained diverse as he refined his playing and singing styles in his preteen years mack was mentored by blind singerguitarist ralph trotto a countrygospel performer mack would skip school to play music with trotto at the latters house mack cited country picker merle travis blues guitarist tbone walker rb guitarist robert ward and popjazz guitarist les paul as significant guitar influences significant vocal influences included rb singers jimmy reed ray charles bobby blue bland and hank ballard country singer george jones traditional black gospel singer archie brownlee and soul music singer wilson pickett mack recorded tunes associated with most of these artistsmacks careerlong pattern of switching and mixing within the entire range of white and black southern roots music genres made him as difficult to market as he was to describe he enjoyed periods of significant commercial success as a rock artist in the 1960s and 1980s but was mostly absent from the rock spotlight for two long stretches of his career 1971–1984 and 1991–2004 during which he continued to perform mostly in small venues as a rootsrock cult figure in the end his influence and standing among musicians far exceeded his commercial successin 1954 at age 13 mack dropped out of school after a fight with a teacher large and maturelooking for his age he obtained a counterfeit id and began performing professionally in bars around cincinnati with a band led by drummer hoot smith as a 14yearold professional electric guitarist in 1955 he was earning 300 per week—more than most workers in the areas casket and whiskey factories at 15 he was performing on local tv with his band the twilighters he played guitar on several lowcirculation recordings in the late 1950sin the early 1960s he became a session guitarist with fraternity records a small cincinnati label in 1963 he recorded two hit singles for fraternity the protobluesrock guitar instrumentals memphis and wham he soon recorded additional tunes to flesh out his debut album the wham of that memphis man mack made some notable recordings later particularly in the 1980s but his debut album released october 1963 is widely considered the centerpiece of his career it became a perennial critics favoritehe recorded many additional sides for fraternity between 1963 and 1967 but few if any were broadly released or strongly promoted and none charted three decades later ace records uk packaged the entirety of macks fraternity output previously released unreleased alternate takes and demos in a series of compilations in the mid1960s however macks commercial prospects were stymied by fraternitys thin financial resources and even more by the arrival of the overwhelmingly popular british invasion only two months after release of the wham of that memphis man it looked like the guitar wizard was ready to bust out when the music world was turned on its ear february 1964 the beatles appeared on the ed sullivan show and macks career withered on the vinealthough his recording career had stalled out mack stayed busy as a performer crisscrossing the country with onenight stands the 60s man we was full of piss and vinegar nothing bothered us we had bennies like the truckers had we just stayed on the road all the time during that time performed with just about everybody jimi hendrix the everly brothers chuck berry and dick and dee dee he also took on session work with james brown freddie king joe simon albert washington and other rbsoul artistsin 1968 at the height of the bluesrock era elektra records bought out macks dormant fraternity recording contract and moved him to los angeles to record three albums in november 1968 the newly founded rolling stone magazine published a rave review of macks discontinued 1963 debut album persuading elektra to reissue it he was soon performing in major rock venues including the fillmore east the fillmore west and the cow palace he opened for the doors and crosby stills nash and shared the stage with johnny winter elvin bishop and other popular rock and blues artists of the timeit was the hippie era however and macks rustic bluecollar persona made for a rough fit with commercial rocks target demographic john morthland wrote the superior chops in the world couldnt hide the fact that chubby country mack probably had more in common with kentucky truck drivers than he did with the new rock audience in addition after two multigenre elektra albums both recorded in 1969 that downplayed his bluesrock strengths including his guitar mack himself was dissatisfied my music wasnt working that good then i ain ’ t really happy with a lot of the stuff i did thereat that point in his career mack took a break from performing and recording according to robbie krieger lead guitarist of elektra labelmate the doors mack was seen during this period selling bibles out of the back of his car he also worked for elektras ar department helping to recruit new talent in 1971 with one album left to complete his contract with elektra mack moved to nashville there he recorded the hills of indiana a multigenre but countryflavored lp with a vocal emphasis it included only one track showcasing his guitar virtuosity asphalt outlaw hero the hills of indiana attracted little attentionmack had begun missing the fun of smalltown performance venues early in his time with elektra and soon soured on the fantasy of rock celebrity status a lot to do with how much value you put on money as opposed to what makes you happy i wasnt happy so one of the bestfeeling moments i ever had was when that la sign was in my rearview mirror and i was free again on another occasion mack said seems like every time i get close to really making it to climbing to the top of the mountain thats when i pull out i just pull up and run upon macks death in 2016 music historian dick shurman observed that macks temperament wasnt suited to stardom i think hed rather have been hunting and fishing he didnt like cities or the music businessin 1971 with his elektra contract completed mack went home to southern indiana where for more than a decade he was a roadhouse performer sideman and lowprofile countrybluegrass recording artist during this period he also owned and operated a nightclub in covington kentucky and an outdoor country music venue in friendship indianain 1974 his composition watch out for lucy was recorded by both dobie gray and bobby penn gray managed to get to no 107 on the us hot 100 bubbling under chart in september and penn got to no 56 on the cash box country top 75 in octoberin 1977 mack was shot during an altercation with an offduty police officer the experience inspired macks tune cincinnati jail a rowdy guitarandvocal rock number that he favored in live performances later in his careerin 1983 mack relocated to austin texas for a collaboration with his bluesrock disciple guitarist stevie ray vaughan vaughan persuaded mack to return to the studio with vaughan in production and backup roles but macks return was postponed by a lengthy illness that mack attributed to so much drinkin and carryin on in 1985 mack staged a fullfledged comeback with the bluesrock album strike like lightning coproduced by vaughan and mack a tour featuring guest appearances by vaughan ry cooder keith richards and ronnie wood and a concert at carnegie hall with albert collins and roy buchananin 1986 mack joined buchanan and dickey betts for the great american guitar assault tourhe released three more albums over the next four years including his last in 1990 a bluesrock lp entitled lonnie mack live – attack of the killer v then worn from the constant touring required to sell records he ended his recording career however he continued to play the roadhouse and festival circuits at his own pace through 2004on march 12 1963 at the end of a recording session backing the charmaines mack was offered the remaining twenty minutes of studiorental time he recorded an energetic instrumental takeoff on chuck berrys memphis tennessee he had improvised it a few years earlier when his keyboardist denzil dumpy rice who normally sang and played the berry tune missed a performance mack didnt know the tunes lyrics but when the audience called for it he improvised a highly embellished electric guitar instrumental grounded in berrys melody he made the instrumental a regular feature of his live act calling it simply memphisas recorded in 1963 memphis featured a brisk melodic blues solo within a rockabillymemphis soul framework augmented by a rock drumbeat it represented a significant advance in rock guitar virtuosity beyond both the prevailing chordsandriffs standard of chuck berry and the inherently simple melodic solos of earlier rock guitar icons eg link wray duane eddy and hank marvinmack recalled that upon recording the tune it didnt mean a thing to me i left to go on the road we hit every roadhouse between cincinnati and miami but we didnt have time to listen to the radio so i didnt know what was going on we were backing chubby checker one night he disc jockey came runnin up to me saying you got the no 1 record on our station by late june memphis had risen to no 4 on billboards rb chart and no 5 on billboards pop chart according to the book of golden discs it sold over one million copies the popularity of memphis led to bookings at larger venues at least one tour in the uk and performances with chuck berrystill in 1963 mack released wham a gospelesque guitar raveup it reached no 24 on billboards pop chart in september although memphis was the bigger hit many associate the fasterpaced wham and the lesserknown but still faster chickenpickin from 1964 with the guitar style he pioneered from legends of rock guitar can be heard using the chordal licks of early rock guitar greats but he infuses his breaks with string bends pentatonic runs and mature blues chops all of which eventually became trademarks of eric clapton mike bloomfield and stevie ray vaughana tight chordal riff laid over a fast boogiewoogie rhythm sets the tone for the cut which contains guitar breaks vibrato arm highlights echoey singlenote lines and the repetitive stringpushing licks that eventually became so prevalent in jeff becks guitar style macks early guitar recordings remain closely identified with the dawn of virtuoso bluesrock guitar music critic bill millar the term ‘ influential ’ is applied to almost anyone these days but theres still a case for saying that the massively popular bluesrock guitar genre can be traced way back to the strength power and emotional passion of lonnie mackwhile still a child mack learned fleetfingered bluegrass and country guitar styles while playing at home in his family band by his late teens mack had expanded his sixstring repertoire to include blues rockabilly and the percussive chordal riffing of early rocks chuck berryin the early 1960s using a bluegrassstyle flatpicking technique he innovated rock guitar solos with a thenperceived peculiar running quality at a million notes per minute by 1963 the year of memphis and wham macks ability to rapidly exploit the entire range of the guitar with topquality technique and pristine phrasing was considerably above the rock music standard in memphis wham chicken pickin suzieq and other early1960s instrumentals he augmented rock guitars thenprevailing chordsandriffs accompaniment style with brisk leads combining melodies runs and mature blues chops his pattern of alternating between agile melodic leads and rhythmic chordal riffs was soon emulated by jeff beck and later by stevie ray vaughan among othersmack enhanced his guitar sound with vibrato effects in his early recordings he used a 1950sera magnatone amplifier to produce a constant electronically generated waterysounding vibrato in the style of rb guitarist robert ward throughout his career he also used a manuallyoperated bigsby vibrato arm to bend the pitch selectively he typically cradled the arm in the fourth finger of his picking hand toggling it while continuing to pick he often fanned it rapidly to the tempo of his simultaneous tremolo picking to produce a machinegunned singlenote shuddering sound neil young considers mack a vibrato arm pioneer did i do that first no youve got to look at guys like lonnie mack he showed everybody how to use a reportedly the device was given its common nickname whammy bar in recognition of macks early demonstration of skill with it in whamwhile some of macks signature performance elements had appeared in early rock saxophone and keyboard solos a seamless combination of all was essentially unheard in rock guitar before mack rock historian dave stephens rates macks overall guitar sound highly distinctive dare i say unique in the early rock era only link wray and duane eddy could match him for instant recognitionalthough notable commercial success was periodic and fleeting macks early1960s recordings became rock guitar trendsetters they raised the bar for rock guitar proficiency helped propel the electric guitar to the top of soloing instruments in rock and served as prototypes for the genres of blues rock and southern rockinterviewed for a biography of southern rock guitar legend duane allman guitarist and early allman associate mike johnstone recalled the professional impact of macks rock guitar proficiency when he and allman were starting out now there was a popular song on the radio called memphis—an instrumental by lonnie mack it was the best guitarplaying id ever heard all the guitarplayers were how could anyone ever play that good thats the new bar thats how good you have to be now another player of that era observed lonnie mack made the other guitarslingers of the day – duane eddy dick dale the ventures – sound tame by comparison only travis wammack and link wray came closemacks edgy aggressive loud and fast blues guitar sound is also credited with a key role in the electric guitars rise to the top of soloing instruments in rock blues critic shawn hagood wrote his playing was faster louder more aggressive than anything people were used to hearing he essentially paved the way for the electric guitar to become a soloing instrument in rock music a true bluesrock pioneer the genre would not have been the same – indeed much of rock music might not have been the same – without his innovative way of treating the electric guitar as a lead soloing instrument in rock – edgy aggressive loud and fast former elektra ar executive james webber agrees lonnie took rock guitar playing to a whole different level you had to really play now efore lonnie the sax guys did all of the lead work he made the guitar the preeminent lead instrument macks early1960s guitar tracks are said to have set the stage for bluesrock guitar and southern rock guitar styles that first enjoyed broad popularity a few years later from legends of rock guitar 1997 is essentially the missing guitar link between the twangy multistring riffing of rockabilly and the bluesy stringpushing players of the midsixties he also made the crucial bridge between the black blues and white hillbilly music via his lead workin all it is not an exaggeration to say that lonnie mack was well ahead of his time in 1963 his bluesy solos predated the pioneering bluesrock guitar work of jeff beck eric clapton and mike bloomfield by nearly two years they are considered before their time the chronological significance of lonnie mack for the world of rock guitar is that much more remarkable southern rock allman brothers lead guitarist warren haynes expressed a similar assessment guitar players true musicians and real music fans realize that lonnie was the jimi hendrix of his time between the era of chuck berry and the era of hendrix there were a handful of guitar players like lonnie mack who were making groundbreaking music that paved the way for the revolution people like dickey betts and stevie ray vaughan would tell you that without lonnie they wouldnt be who they were that goes for all of us macks 1963 debut album has been called the first of the guitar hero records for its introduction of flashy technically challenging melodies and runs to rock guitar solos as such it is said to have begun rock guitars modern era in 1980 memphis 1963 led guitar world magazines list of rock guitars topfive landmark recordings ahead of entire albums by jimi hendrix eric clapton elvin bishop and mike bloomfield whose own bluesinfused solos exemplified rocks lead guitar revolution of the late 1960saccording to the new york times macks guitar style was a seminal influence on a long list of british and american rock guitar soloists those

attracted to the arrowlike shape of the guitar mack played number 7 almost exclusively throughout his career the title of macks final album attack of the killer v was a reference to his guitarearly in his career mack added a bigsby vibrato bar to the guitar it required mounting a steel crossbeam approximately six inches below the apex of the v giving the guitar a unique appearance mack favored
