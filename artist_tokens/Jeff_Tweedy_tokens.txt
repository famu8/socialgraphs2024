bragg who in turn contacted tweedy about recording an album of unreleased woody guthrie songs tweedy was indifferent to the idea of working with bragg but jay bennetts enthusiasm about the idea

played with loose fur tweedy became such a fan of kotches playing style that he decided to dismiss ken coomer from the band in favor of kotche 176–183 188 tweedy had strong feelings about how songs should be sequenced which clashed with jay bennetts focus on the songs themselves because bennett was mixing the album this led to a series of arguments between songs about how the album should sound

that it was in its final form 197–200 tweedy also fired bennett around this time believing according to bennett that wilco should only have one core member the band maintains that the firing of
