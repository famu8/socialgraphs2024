songs is a bit strange i just sit down and itll be five minutes and the song will just come out on paper and then ill have to look back on it and go right does this make sense i hardly ever change my words ever i always just write them down and thats it that real fiveminute rush i guess for some lyrics she would check with her parents i really didnt even know what it meant and that happens a lot
