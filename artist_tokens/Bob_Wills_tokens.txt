and wills point he opened a second club the bob wills ranch house in dallas texas turning the club over to managers later revealed to be dishonest left wills in desperate financial straits with heavy debts to the irs for back taxes this caused him to sell many assets including the rights to new san antonio rosein 1950 wills had two top 10 hits ida red likes the boogie and faded love after 1950 radio stations began to increasingly specialize in one form or another of commercially popular music although usually labelled country and western wills did not fit into the style played on popular country and western stations which typically played music in the nashville sound neither did he fit into the conventional sound of pop stations although he played a good deal of pop musicwills continued to appear at the bostonia ballroom in san diego throughout the 1950s he continued to tour and record through the 1950s into the early 1960s despite the fact that western swings popularity even in the southwest had greatly diminished charles r townsend described his drop in popularity bob could draw a thousand people on monday night between 1950 and 1952 but he could not do that by 1956 entertainment habits had changedon wills return to tulsa late in 1957 jim downing of the tulsa tribune wrote an article headlined wills brothers together again bob back with heavy beat the article quotes wills as saying rock and roll why man thats the same kind of music weve been playin since 1928 we didnt call it rock and roll back when we introduced it as our style back in 1928 and we dont call it rock and roll the way we play it now but its just basic rhythm and has gone by a lot of different names in my time its the same whether you just follow a drum beat like in africa or surround it with a lot of instruments the rhythms whats important the use of amplified guitars accentuates willss claim some bob wills recordings from the 1930s and 1940s sound similar to rock and roll records of the 1950seven a 1958 return to kvoo where his younger brother johnnie lee wills had maintained the familys presence did not produce the success he hoped he appeared twice on abctvs jubilee usa and kept the band on the road into the 1960s after two heart attacks in 1965 he dissolved the texas playboys who briefly continued as an independent unit to perform solo with house bands while he did well in las vegas and other areas and made records for the kapp records label he was largely a forgotten figure—even though inducted into the country music hall of fame in 1968 a 1969 stroke left his right side paralyzed ending his active career he did however recover sufficiently to appear in a wheelchair at various wills tributes held in the early 1970s a revival of interest in his music spurred by

as did the appearance of younger revival bands like asleep at the wheel and commander cody and his lost planet airmen plus the growing popularity of longtime wills disciple and fan willie nelson by 1971 wills recovered sufficiently to travel occasionally and appear at tribute concerts in 1973 he participated in a final reunion session with members of some of the texas playboys from the 1930s to the 1960s merle haggard was invited to play at this reunion the session scheduled for two days took place in december 1973 with the album to be titled for the last time wills speaking or attempting to
