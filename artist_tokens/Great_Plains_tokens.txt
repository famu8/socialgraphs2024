the great plains are a broad expanse of flatland in north america the region is located just to the east of the rocky mountains much of it covered in prairie steppe and grassland they are the western part of the interior plains which include the mixed grass prairie the tallgrass prairie between the great lakes and appalachian plateau and the taiga plains and boreal plains ecozones in northern canada great plains or western plains is also the ecoregion of the great plains or alternatively the western portion of the great plainsthe great plains lie across both the central united states and western canada encompassingthe term great plains is used in the united states to describe a subsection of the even more vast interior plains physiographic division which covers much of the interior of north america it also has currency as a region of human geography referring to the plains indians or the plains statesin canada the term is rarely used natural resources canada the government department responsible for official mapping treats the interior plains as one unit consisting of several related plateaus and plains there is no region referred to as the great plains in the atlas of canada in terms of human geography the term prairie is more commonly used in canada and the region is known as the canadian prairies prairie provinces or simply the prairiesthe north american environmental atlas produced by the commission for environmental cooperation a north american free trade agreement nafta agency composed of the geographical agencies of the mexican american and canadian governments uses the great plains as an ecoregion synonymous with predominant prairies and grasslands rather than as physiographic region defined by topography the great plains ecoregion includes five subregions temperate prairies westcentral semiarid prairies southcentral semiarid prairies texas louisiana coastal plains and tamaulipastexas semiarid plain which overlap or expand upon other great plains designationsthe region is about 500 mi 800 km east to west and 2000 mi 3200 km north to south much of the region was home to american bison herds until they were hunted to near extinction during the midlate19th century it has an area of approximately 500000 sq mi 1300000 km2 current thinking regarding the geographic boundaries of the great plains is shown by this map at the center for great plains studies university of nebraska–lincoln this definition however is primarily ecological not physiographic the boreal plains of western canada are physiographically the same but differentiated by their tundra and forest rather than grassland appearancethe term great plains for the region west of about the 96th meridian west and east of the rocky mountains was not generally used before the early 20th century nevin fennemans 1916 study physiographic subdivision of the united states brought the term great plains into more widespread usage before that the region was almost invariably called the high plains in contrast to the lower prairie plains of the midwestern states today the term high plains is used for a subregion of the great plains the term still remains littleused in canada compared to the more common prairiethe great plains are the westernmost portion of the vast north american interior plains which extend east to the appalachian plateau the united states geological survey divides the great plains in the united states into ten physiographic subdivisionsfurther to this can be added canadian physiographic subregions such as the alberta plain cypress hills manitoba escarpment eastward manitoba plain missouri coteau shared rocky mountain foothills eastward and saskatchewan plainthe great plains consist of a broad stretch of country underlain by nearly horizontal strata extending westward from the 97th meridian west to the base of the rocky mountains a distance of 300 to 500 mi 480 to 800 km it extends northward from the mexican boundary far into canada although the altitude of the plains increases gradually from 600 ft 180 m or 1200 ft 370 m on the east to 4000–5000 ft 1200–1500 m or 6000 ft 1800 m near the mountains the local relief is generally small the semiarid climate excludes tree growth and opens farreaching viewsthe plains are by no means a simple unit they are of diverse structure and of various stages of erosional development they are occasionally interrupted by buttes and escarpments they are frequently broken by valleys yet on the whole a broadly extended surface of moderate relief so often prevails that the name great plains for the region as a whole is welldeservedthe western boundary of the plains is usually welldefined by the abrupt ascent of the mountains the eastern boundary of the plains in the united states is more climatic than topographic the line of 20 in 510 mm of annual rainfall trends a little east of northward near the 97th meridian if a boundary must be drawn where nature presents only a gradual transition this rainfall line may be taken to divide the drier plains from the moister prairies however in canada the eastern boundary of the plains is well defined by the presence of the canadian shield to the northeastthe plains within the united states may be described in northern intermediate central and southern sections in relation to certain peculiar features in canada no such division is used the climatic and vegetation regions are more impactful on human settlement than mere topography and therefore the region is split into from north to south the taiga plains boreal plains aspen parkland and prairie ecoregion regionsthe northern section of the great plains north of latitude 44° includes eastern montana eastern wyoming most of north dakota and south dakota southwestern minnesota and portions of the canadian provinces including southeastern alberta southern saskatchewan and southwestern manitoba the strata here are cretaceous or early tertiary lying nearly horizontal the surface is shown to be a plain of degradation by a gradual ascent here and there to the crest of a ragged escarpment the escarpmentremnant of a resistant stratum there are also the occasional lavacapped mesas and dike formed ridges surmounting the general level by 500 ft 150 m or more and manifestly demonstrating the widespread erosion of the surrounding plains all these reliefs are more plentiful towards the mountains in central montana the peneplain is no longer in the cycle of erosion that witnessed its production it appears to have suffered a regional uplift or increase in elevation for the upper missouri river and its branches no longer flow on the surface of the plain but in well graded maturely opened valleys several hundred feet below the general level a significant exception to the rule of mature valleys occurs however in the case of the missouri the largest river which is broken by several falls on hard sandstones about 50 mi 80 km east of the mountains this peculiar feature is explained as the result of displacement of the river from a better graded preglacial valley by the pleistocene ice sheet here the ice sheet overspread the plains from the moderately elevated canadian highlands far on the northeast instead of from the much higher mountains nearby on the west the present altitude of the plains near the mountain base is 4000 ft 1200 mthe northern plains are interrupted by several small mountain areas the black hills chiefly in western south dakota are the largest group they rise like a large island from the sea occupying an oval area of about 100 mi 160 km northsouth by 50 mi 80 km eastwest at black elk peak they reach an altitude of 7216 ft 2199 m and have an effective relief over the plains of 2000 or 3000 ft 610 or 910 m this mountain mass is of flatarched domelike structure now well dissected by radiating consequent streams the weaker uppermost strata have been eroded down to the level of the plains where their upturned edges are evenly truncated the next following harder strata have been sufficiently eroded to disclose the core of underlying igneous and metamorphic crystalline rocks in about half of the domed areain the intermediate section of the plains between latitudes 44° and 42° including southern south dakota and northern nebraska the erosion of certain large districts is peculiarly elaborate known as the badlands it is a minutely dissected form with a relief of a few hundred feet this is due to several causesthe central section of the great plains between latitudes 42° and 36° occupying eastern colorado and western kansas is mostly a dissected fluviatile plain that is this section was once smoothly covered with a gently sloping plain of gravel and sand that had been spread far forward on a broad denuded area as a piedmont deposit by the rivers which issued from the mountains since then it has been more or less dissected by the erosion of valleys the central section of the plains thus presents a marked contrast to the northern sectionwhile the northern section owes its smoothness to the removal of local gravels and sands from a formerly uneven surface by the action of degrading rivers and their inflowing tributaries the southern section owes its smoothness to the deposition of imported gravels and sands upon a previously uneven surface by the action of aggrading rivers and their outgoing distributaries the two sections are also alike in that residual eminences still here and there surmount the peneplain of the northern section while the fluviatile plain of the central section completely buried the preexistent relief an exception to this statement must be made for the southwest close to the mountains in southern colorado where some lavacapped mesas mesa de maya raton mesa stand several thousand feet above the general plain level and thus testify to the widespread erosion of this region before it was aggradedthe southern section of the great plains between latitudes 355° and 255° lies in western texas eastern new mexico and western oklahoma like the central section it is for the most part a dissected fluviatile plain however the lower lands which surround it on all sides place it in such strong relief that it stands up as a tableland known from the time of mexican occupation as the llano estacado it measures roughly 150 mi 240 km eastwest and 400 mi 640 km northsouth it is of very irregular outline narrowing to the south its altitude is 5500 ft 1700 m at the highest western point nearest the mountains whence its gravels were supplied from there it slopes southeastward at a decreasing rate first about 12 ft 37 m then about 7 ftmi 13 mkm to its eastern and southern borders where it is 2000 ft 610 m in altitude like the high plains farther north it is extraordinarily smoothit is very dry except for occasional shallow and temporary water sheets after rains llano is separated from the plains on the north by the mature consequent valley of the canadian river and from the mountains on the west by the broad and probably mature valley of the pecos river on the east it is strongly undercut by the retrogressive erosion of the headwaters of the red brazos and colorado rivers of texas and presents a ragged escarpment approximately 500 to 800 ft 150 to 240 m high overlooking the central denuded area of that state there between the brazos and colorado rivers occurs a series of isolated outliers capped by limestone that underlies both the llano uplift on the west and the grand prairies escarpment on the east the southern and narrow part of the tableland called the edwards plateau is more dissected than the rest and falls off to the south in a frayedout fault scarp this scarp overlooks the coastal plain of the rio grande embayment the central denuded area east of the llano resembles the eastcentral section of the plains in exposing older rocks between these two similar areas in the space limited by the canadian and red rivers rise the subdued forms of the wichita mountains in oklahoma the westernmost member of the ouachita systemthe term western plains is used to describe the ecoregion of the great plains or alternatively the western portion of the great plainsin general the great plains have a wide range of weather with very cold and harsh winters and very hot and humid summers wind speeds are often very high especially in winterthe 100th meridian roughly corresponds with the line that divides the great plains into an area that receives 20 in 510 mm or more of rainfall per year and an area that receives less than 20 in 510 mm in this context the high plains as well as southern alberta southwestern saskatchewan and eastern montana are mainly semi arid steppe land and are generally characterised by rangeland or marginal farmland the region especially the high plains is periodically subjected to extended periods of drought high winds in the region may then generate devastating dust storms the eastern great plains near the eastern boundary falls in the humid subtropical climate zone in the southern areas and the northern and central areas fall in the humid continental climatemany thunderstorms occur in the plains in the spring through summer the southeastern portion of the great plains is the most tornado active area in the world and is sometimes referred to as tornado alleythe great plains are part of the floristic north american prairies province which extends from the rocky mountains to the appalachiansalthough the american bison bison bison historically ranged throughout much of north america from new york to oregon and canada to northern mexico they are strongly associated with the great plains where they once roamed in immense herds pronghorn antilocapra americana range into western areas of the region the blacktailed prairie dog cynomys ludovicianus is another iconic species among several rodents that are linked to the region including the thirteenlined ground squirrel ictidomys tridecemlineatus spotted ground squirrel xerospermophilus spilosoma franklins ground squirrel poliocitellus franklinii plains pocket gopher geomys bursarius hispid pocket mouse chaetodipus hispidus olivebacked pocket mouse perognathus fasciatus plains pocket mouse perognathus flavescens and plains harvest mouse reithrodontomys montanus two carnivores associated with the great plains include the swift fox vulpes velox and the endangered blackfooted ferret mustela nigripesthe lesser prairie chicken tympanuchus pallidicinctus is endemic to the great plains and the distribution of the greater prairie chicken tympanuchus cupido predominantly occurs in the region although the latter historically ranged further eastward the harriss sparrow zonotrichia querula spends winter months in southern areas of the region other species migrate from the south in the spring and spend their breeding season on the plains including the whitefaced ibis

nevadica lincolniana great plains giant tiger beetle amblycheila chylindriformis microstylum morosum bean leaf beetle cerotoma trifurcata great plains camel cricket daihinia brevipes and the great plains spittlebug lepyronia gibbosa some species in the great plains have gone extinct in the great plains like the rocky mountain locust melanoplus spretusduring the cretaceous period 145–66 million years ago the great plains were covered by a shallow inland sea called the western interior seaway however during the late cretaceous to the paleocene 65–55 million years ago the seaway had begun to recede leaving behind thick marine deposits and a relatively flat terrain which the seaway had once occupiedduring the cenozoic era specifically about 25 million years ago during the miocene and pliocene epochs the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread the grasslands provided a new niche for mammals including many ungulates and glires that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets traditionally the spread of grasslands and the development of grazers have been strongly linked however an examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes in mammals giving rise to the grit not grass hypothesispaleontological finds in the area have yielded bones of mammoths sabertoothed cats and other ancient animals as well as dozens of other megafauna large animals over 100 lb – such as giant sloths horses mastodons and american lion – that dominated the area of the ancient great plains for thousands to millions of years the vast majority of these animals became extinct in north america at the end of the pleistocene around 13000 years agoa number of significant fossil sites are located in the great plains including agate fossil beds national monument nebraska ashfall fossil beds nebraska clayton lake state park new mexico dinosaur valley state park texas hudsonmeng bison kill nebraska makoshika state park montana and the mammoth site south dakotapublic and protected lands in the great plains include national parks and national monuments administers by the national park service with the responsibility of preserving ecological and historical places and making them available to the public the us fish wildlife service manages the national wildlife refuges with the primary responsibility of conserving and protecting fish wildlife plants and habitat in the public trust both are agencies of the department of the interiorin contrast us forest service an agency of the u s department of agriculture administers the national forests and national grasslands under a multipleuse concept by law the us forest service must consider all resources with no single resource emphasized to the detriment of others including water soil grazing timber harvesting and minerals mining and drilling as well as recreation and conservation of fish and wildlife each individual state also administers state lands typically smaller areas for various purposes including conservation and recreationgrasslands are among the least protected biomes humans have converted much of the prairies for agricultural purposes or to create pastures several of the protected lands in the region are centered around aberrant and uncharacteristic features of the region such as mountains outcrops and canyons eg devils tower national monument wind cave national park scotts bluff national monument and as splendid and worthy as they are they are not primarily focused on conserving the plains and prairiesunited statescanadathe great plains biome is found to be at the brink of collapse due to woody plant encroachment with 62 of northern american grassland lost to datethe first peoples paleoindians arrived on the great plains thousands of years ago the introduction of corn around 800 ce allowed the development of the moundbuilding mississippian culture along rivers that crossed the great plains and that included trade networks west to the rocky mountains mississippians settled the great plains at sites now in oklahoma and south dakotasiouan language speakers may have originated in the lower mississippi river region they were agriculturalists and may have been part of the mound builder civilization during the 9th–12th centuriespressure from other indian tribes themselves driven west and south by the encroachment of european settlers as well as economic incentives such as the fur trade alongside the arrival of the horse and firearms from europe pushed multiple tribes onto the great plainsamong those to have lived on the great plains were the blackfoot crow sioux cheyenne arapaho comanche and others eastern portions of the great plains were inhabited by tribes who lived at etzanoa and in semipermanent villages of earth lodges such as the arikara mandan pawnee and wichitawars with the ojibwe and cree peoples pushed the lakota teton sioux west onto the great plains in the mid to late17th century the shoshone originated in the western great basin and spread north and east into presentday idaho and wyoming by 1500 some eastern shoshone had crossed the rocky mountains into the great plains after 1750 warfare and pressure from the blackfoot crow lakota cheyenne and arapaho pushed eastern shoshone south and westward some of them moved as far south as texas emerging as the comanche by 1700the first known contact between europeans and indians in the great plains occurred in what is now texas kansas and nebraska from 1540 to 1542 with the arrival of francisco vázquez de coronado a spanish conquistador in that same period hernando de soto crossed a westnorthwest direction in what is now oklahoma and texas which is now known as the de soto trail the spanish thought that the great plains were the location of the mythological quivira and cíbola a place said to be rich in goldpeople in the southwest began to acquire horses in the 16th century by trading or stealing them from spanish colonists in new mexico as horse culture moved northward the comanche were among the first to commit to a fully mounted nomadic lifestyle this occurred by the 1730s when they had acquired enough horses to put all their people on horsebackthe real beginning of the horse culture of the plains began with the pueblo revolt of 1680 in new mexico and the capture of thousands of horses and other livestock in 1683 a spanish expedition into texas found horses among native people in 1690 a few horses were found by the spanish among the indians living at the mouth of the colorado river of texas and the caddo of eastern texas had a sizeable numberthe french explorer claude charles du tisne found 300 horses among the wichita on the verdigris river in 1719 but they were still not plentiful another frenchman bourgmont could only buy seven at a high price from the kaw in 1724 indicating that horses were still scarce among tribes in kansas by 1770 that plains indians culture was mature consisting of mounted buffalohunting nomads from saskatchewan and alberta southward nearly to the rio grandethe milder winters of the southern plains favored a pastoral economy by the indians on the northeastern plains of canada the indians were less favored with families owning fewer horses remaining more dependent upon dogs for transporting goods and hunting bison on foot the scarcity of horses in the north encouraged raiding and warfare in competition for the relatively small number of horses that survived the severe winterscomanche power peaked in the 1840s when they conducted largescale raids hundreds of miles into mexico proper while also warring against the angloamericans and tejanos who had settled in independent texasthe fur trade brought thousands of colonial settlers into the great plains over the next 100 years fur trappers made their way across much of the region making regular contacts with indiansthe hudsons bay company hbc had first been granted in 1670 a commercial monopoly over the huge hudson bay drainage area known as ruperts land covering a northern portion of the great plains the north west company fur trade incumbent had also been present in the area until acquired by the hbc during the early 1820sthe united states acquired the louisiana purchase in 1803 and conducted the lewis and clark expedition in 1804–1806 and more information became available concerning the plains and various pioneers entered the areas fur trading posts were often the basis of later settlements through the 19th century more settlers migrated to the great plains as part of a vast westward expansion of population and new settlements became dotted across the great plainsthe settlers also brought diseases against which the indians had no resistance between a half and twothirds of the plains indians are thought to have died of smallpox by the time of the louisiana purchase the 1837 great plains smallpox epidemic spread across the great plains killing many thousands between 1837 and 1840 in the end it is estimated that twothirds of the blackfoot population died along with half of the assiniboines and arikaras a third of the crows and a quarter of the pawneesbeginning in 1821 the santa fe trail ran from the missouri river to new mexico skirting north of comancheria beginning in the 1830s the oregon trail led from the missouri river across the great plainsmuch of the great plains became open range where cattle roamed free hosting ranching operations where anyone was free to run cattle in the spring and fall ranchers held roundups where their cowboys branded new calves treated animals and sorted the cattle for sale such ranching began in texas and gradually moved northward between 1866 and 1895 cowboys herded 10 million cattle north to rail heads such as dodge city kansas and ogallala nebraska from there cattle were shipped eastpassage of the kansasnebraska act in 1854 opened both territories to white settlement the homestead acts of 1862 further encouraged settlement and agricultural development in the great plains the population of nebraska for instance increased from under 30000 in 1860 to over one million in 1890 a homesteader was permitted to claim up to 160 acres 65 ha of land for only a small filing fee provided that he or she lived on the land for a period of five years and cultivated it the provisions were expanded under the kinkaid act of 1904 to include a homestead of an entire section hundreds of thousands of people claimed such homesteads sometimes building houses out of the very turf of the land many of them were not skilled farmers and failures were frequent the canadian dominion lands act of 1871 served a similar function for establishing homesteads on the prairies in canadaafter 1870 the new railroads across the plains brought hunters who killed off almost all the bison for their hides the railroads offered attractive packages of land and transportation to american farmers who rushed to settle the land they also took advantage of the homestead laws to obtain farms land speculators and local boosters identified many potential towns and those reached by the railroad had a chance while the others became ghost towns towns flourished if they were favored by proximity to the railroadthe population of minnesota dakota nebraska and kansas experienced significant growth during the 1870s the total population in these states grew from 10 million in 1870 to 24 million in 1880 more than doubling in just 10 years the number of farms in the region tripled increasing from 99000 in 1870 to 302000 in 1880 the improved acreage land under cultivation quintupled rising from 50 million acres to 246 million acres during the same period the new settlers mostly purchased land on generous terms from transcontinental railroads that were given land grants by washington they focused on wheat and cattle this rapid population influx and agricultural expansion was a hallmark of the settlement and development of the great plains in the late 19th century as the region attracted waves of new settlers from germany scandinavia and russia as well as farmers who sold land in older states to move to larger farmsthe first white settlements in the great plains were forts particularly along the santa fe trail and trading posts some of the first built were the railroads opened up the great plains for settlement making it possible to ship wheat and other crops at low cost to the urban markets in the east and overseas homestead land was free for american settlers railroads sold their land at cheap rates to immigrants in the expectation that they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established immigrants poured in especially from germany and scandinavia on the plains very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves they understood the need for a hardworking wife and numerous children to handle the many responsibilities during the early years of settlement farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors after approximately one generation women increasingly left the fields thus redefining their roles within the family new technology encouraged women to turn to domestic roles including sewing and washing machines media and government extension agents promoted the scientific housekeeping movement along with county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning advice columns for women regarding farm book keeping and home economics courses in the schoolsthe eastern image of farm life in the prairies emphasized the isolation of the lonely farmer and wife yet plains residents created busy social lives for themselves they often sponsored activities which combined work food and entertainment such as barn raisings corn huskings quilting bees grange meetings church activities and school functions women organized shared meals and potluck events as well as extended visits among familiesthe progressive movement was a reform movement that took place in all parts of the country during the late 19th and early 20th centuries the movement sought to address social political and economic problems that had arisen as a result of the industrial revolution progressives believed that the government could play a role in solving these problems by regulating businesses protecting workers and providing social welfare programsthe plains states were a hotbed of progressive activity many of the reforms that were enacted at the national level were first implemented in the plains states for example the initiative and referendum process which allows voters to directly enact laws was first adopted in south dakota in 1898 the direct primary which allows voters to choose their partys candidates in primary elections was first adopted in wisconsin in 1903progressive reformers in the great plains focused on high priority issues especiallyprogressives in the great plains were more likely to support direct democracy woman suffrage and prohibition than their counterparts elsewhere they were also more likely to favor stateowned enterprises especially those devoted to economic development plains progressivism was more radical than progressivism in eastern states with a greater focus on direct democracy woman suffrage and prohibition plains progressives were more isolationist regarding foreign policy largely in response to the large german and scandinavian elements socialists were more active than elsewhere progressive reforms had a significant longterm impact on the region they helped to improve the lives of workers farmers and consumers they also helped to make the plains states more democratic and responsive to the needs of their citizensthe region roughly centered on the oklahoma panhandle was known as the dust bowl during the late 1920s and early 1930s including southeastern colorado southwestern kansas the texas panhandle and extreme northeastern new mexico the effects of an extended drought inappropriate cultivation and financial crises of the great depression forced many farmers off the land throughout the great plainsfrom the 1950s on many areas of the great plains have become productive cropgrowing areas because of extensive irrigation on large landholdings the united states is a major exporter of agricultural products the southern portion of the great plains lies over the ogallala aquifer a huge underground layer of waterbearing strata center pivot irrigation is used extensively in drier sections of the great plains resulting in aquifer depletion at a rate that is greater than the grounds ability to rechargethe rural plains have lost a third of their population since 1920 several hundred thousand square miles of the great plains have fewer than 6 inhabitants per square mile 23km2 the density standard that frederick jackson turner used to declare the american frontier closed in 1893 many have fewer than 2 inhabitants per square mile 077km2 there are more than 6000 ghost towns in kansas alone according to kansas historian daniel fitzgerald this problem is often exacerbated by the consolidation of farms and the difficulty of attracting modern industry to the region in addition the smaller schoolage population has forced the consolidation of school districts and the closure of high schools in some communities the continuing population loss has led some to suggest that the current use of the drier parts of the great plains is not sustainable and there has been a proposal to return approximately 139000 sq mi 360000 km2 of these drier parts to native prairie land as a buffalo commonsthe great plains contributes substantially to wind power in the united states t boone pickens developed wind farms after a career as a petroleum executive and he called for the us to invest 1 trillion to build an additional 200000 mw of wind power in the plains as part of his pickens plan he cited sweetwater texas as an example of economic revitalization driven by wind power development
