william smith monroe mənˈroʊ mənroh september 13 1911 – september 9 1996 was an american mandolinist singer and songwriter and created the bluegrass music genre because of this he is often called the father of bluegrassthe genre takes its name from his band the blue grass boys who named their group for the bluegrass of monroes home state of kentucky he described the genre as scottish bagpipes and oletime fiddlin its methodist and holiness and baptist its blues and jazz and it has a high lonesome soundmonroe was born on his familys farm near rosine kentucky the youngest of eight children of james buchanan buck and malissa vandiver monroe his mother and her brother james pendleton pen vandiver were both musically talented and monroe and his family grew up playing and singing at homebill was of scottish and english heritage because his older brothers birch and charlie already played the fiddle and guitar bill was resigned to playing the less desirable mandolin he recalled that his brothers insisted that he remove four of the mandolins eight strings so he would not play too loudlymonroes mother died when he was ten and his father died six years later eventually his brothers and sisters moved away leaving monroe to bounce between uncles and aunts until finally settling in with his disabled uncle pendleton vandiver whom he often accompanied when vandiver played the fiddle at dances this experience inspired one of monroes most famous compositions uncle pen recorded in 1950 and the 1972 album bill monroes uncle pen on that album monroe recorded a number of traditional fiddle tunes he had often heard performed by vandiver vandiver has been credited with giving monroe a repertoire of tunes that sank into bills aurally trained memory and a sense of rhythm that seeped into his bonesalso significant in monroes musical life was arnold shultz an influential fiddler and guitarist who introduced monroe to the bluesin 1929 monroe moved to indiana to work at an oil refinery with his brothers birch and charlie together with a friend larry moore they formed the monroe brothers to play at local dances and house partiesbirch and moore soon left the group and bill and charlie carried on as a duo eventually winning spots performing live on radio stations first in indiana and then sponsored by texas crystals on several radio broadcasts in shenandoah iowa nebraska south carolina and north carolina from 1934 to 1936 rca victor signed the monroe brothers to a recording contract in 1936 they scored an immediate hit single with the gospel song what would you give in exchange for your soul and ultimately recorded 60 tracks for victors bluebird label between 1936 and 1938after the monroe brothers disbanded in 1938 bill monroe formed the kentuckians in little rock arkansas but the group only lasted for three months monroe then left little rock for atlanta georgia to form the first edition of the blue grass boys with singerguitarist cleo davis fiddler art wooten and bassist amos garrenin october 1939 monroe successfully auditioned for a regular spot on the grand ole opry impressing opry founder george d hay with his energetic performance of jimmie rodgerss mule skinner blues monroe recorded that song along with seven others at his first solo recording session for rca victor in 1940 by this time the blue grass boys consisted of singerguitarist clyde moody fiddler tommy magness and bassist bill wesbrookswhile the fast tempos and instrumental virtuosity characteristic of bluegrass music are apparent even on these early tracks monroe was still experimenting with the sound of his group he seldom sang lead vocals on his victor recordings often preferring to contribute high tenor harmonies as he had in the monroe brothers a 1945 session for columbia records featured an accordion soon dropped from the band most importantly monroe added banjo player david stringbean akeman to the blue grass boys in 1942 akeman played the instrument in a relatively primitive style and was rarely featured in instrumental solos monroes pre1946 recordings represent a transitional style between the stringband tradition from which he came and the musical innovation to followkey developments occurred in monroes music with the addition of lester flatt and earl scruggs to the blue grass boys in december 1945 flatt played a solid rhythm guitar style that would help to set the course for bluegrass timing scruggs played the banjo with a distinctive threefinger picking style that immediately caused a sensation among opry audiences flatt and scruggs joined a highly accomplished group that included fiddler howdy forrester and bassist joe forrester and would soon include fiddler chubby wise and bassist howard watts who often performed under the name cedric rainwaterin retrospect this lineup of the blue grass boys has been dubbed the original bluegrass band as the music finally included all the elements that characterize bluegrass music including breakneck tempos sophisticated vocal harmony arrangements and impressive instrumental proficiency demonstrated in solos or breaks on the mandolin banjo and fiddle by this time monroe had acquired the 1923 gibson f5 model lloyd loar mandolin which became his trademark instrument for the remainder of his careerthe 28 songs recorded by this version of the blue grass boys for columbia records in 1946 and 1947 soon became classics of the genre including toy heart blue grass breakdown molly and tenbrooks wicked path of sin my rose of old kentucky little cabin home on the hill and monroes most famous song blue moon of kentucky which was recorded by elvis presley in 1954 appearing as the bside of his first single for sun records monroe gave his blessing to presleys rock and roll cover of the song originally a slow ballad in waltz time and rerecorded it himself with a faster arrangement after presleys version became a hit several gospelthemed numbers are credited to the blue grass quartet which featured fourpart vocal arrangements accompanied solely by mandolin and guitar – monroes usual practice when performing sacred songsboth flatt and scruggs left monroes band in early 1948 soon forming their own group the foggy mountain boys in 1949 after signing with decca records monroe entered what has been called the golden age of his career with what many consider the classic high lonesome version of the blue grass boys featuring the lead vocals and rhythm guitar of jimmy martin the banjo of rudy lyle replacing don reno and fiddlers such as merle red taylor charlie cline bobby hicks and vassar clementsthis band recorded a number of bluegrass classics including my little georgia rose on and on memories of mother and dad and uncle pen as well as instrumentals such as roanoke big mon stoney lonesome get up john and the mandolin feature raw hide carter stanley joined the blue grass boys as guitarist for a short time in 1951 during a period when the stanley brothers had temporarily disbandedon january 16 1953 monroe was critically injured in a twocar wreck he and bluegrass boys bass player bessie lee mauldin were returning home from a fox hunt north of nashville on highway 31w near white house their car was struck by a drunken driver monroe who had suffered injuries to his back left arm and nose was rushed to general hospital in nashville it took him almost four months to recover and resume touring in the meantime charlie cline and jimmy martin kept the band togetherby the late 1950s however monroes commercial fortunes had begun to slip the rise of rockandroll and the development of the nashville sound in mainstream country music both represented threats to the viability of bluegrass while still a mainstay on the grand ole opry monroe found diminishing success on the singles charts and struggled to keep his band together in the face of declining demand for live performancesmonroes fortunes began to improve during the american folk music revival of the early 1960s many college students and other young people were beginning to discover monroe associating his style more with traditional folk music than with the countryandwestern genre with which it had previously been identifiedthe word bluegrass first appeared around this time to describe the sound of monroe and similar artists such as flatt and scruggs the stanley brothers reno and smiley jim and jesse and the osborne brothers while flatt and scruggs immediately recognized the potential for a lucrative new audience in cities and on college campuses in the north monroe was slower to respond under the influence of ralph rinzler a young musician and folklorist from new jersey who briefly became monroes manager in 1963 monroe gradually expanded his geographic reach beyond the traditional southern country music circuit rinzler was also responsible for a lengthy profile and interview in the influential folk music magazine sing out that first publicly referred to monroe as the father of bluegrass accordingly at the first bluegrass festival organized by carlton haney at roanoke virginia in 1965 bill monroe was the central figurein 1964 before the grateful dead got together jerry garcia caravanned across the country from california to tag along with monroethe growing national popularity of monroes music during the 1960s was also apparent in the increasingly

massachusetts fiddler gene lowinger from new jersey banjo player lamar grier from maryland banjo player steve arkin from new york and singerguitarist roland white and fiddler richard greene from californiaeven after the folk revival faded in the mid1960s it left a loyal audience for bluegrass music bluegrass festivals became common with fans often traveling long distances to see a number of different acts over several days of performancesin 1967 monroe himself founded an annual bluegrass festival at bean blossom in southern indiana a park he had purchased in 1951 which routinely attracted a crowd of thousands a double lp from the festival featuring monroe jimmy martin lester flatt and jim and jesse was released in 1973 the annual bill monroe bean blossom bluegrass festival is now the worlds oldest continuously running annual bluegrass festivalmonroes compositions during his later period were largely instrumentals including jerusalem ridge old dangerfield originally spelled daingerfield after the town in east texas and my last days on earth he settled into a new role as a musical patriarch who continued to influence younger generations of musicians monroe recorded two albums of duets in the 1980s the first featured collaborations with country stars such as emmylou harris waylon jennings and the oak ridge boys while the second paired him with other prominent
