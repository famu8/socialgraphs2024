the then prince of wales later king edward vii 1841–1910 the late 19th century saw gradual introduction of the lounge jacket without tails as a less formal and more comfortable leisure alternative to the frock coat similarly the shorter dinner jacket evolved as a less formal alternative to the dress coat out of the informal smoking jacket itself derived from the banyan thus in many nonenglish languages a dinner jacket is still known as the false friend smoking in american english its synonym tuxedo was derived from the village of tuxedo park in new york state where it was introduced in 1886 following the example of europeans following the counterculture of the 1960s black tie has increasingly replaced white tie for more formal settings in the united states along with cultures

the context of menswear first appeared in the united kingdom around 1887 and in the united states around 1889 in the 1960s it became associated in the united states with white or coloured jackets specifically in modern british english dinner jacket may be abbreviated to simply djtuxedo in the context of menswear originated in the united states around 1888 it was named after tuxedo park a hudson valley enclave for new yorks social elite where it was often seen in its early years the term was capitalized until the 1930s and traditionally referred only to a white jacket when the jacket was later paired with its own unique trousers and accessories in the 1900s the term began to be associated with the entire suit sometimes it is shortened to tuxin a number of european and other languages the style is referred to by the pseudoanglicism smoking this generic colloquialism comes from its similarity to the 19th century smoking jacket in french the dress code may also be called cravate noire a term that is sometimes adopted directly into englishthe suit with accompanying accessories is sometimes nicknamed a monkey suit and since 1918 soup and fish – a term derived from the sort of food thought to be served at black tie dinnersin the 1860s the increasing popularity of outdoor activities among the middle and upper classes of the uk led to a corresponding increase in the popularity of the then casual lounge suit as a country alternative to the more formal day wear frock coat that was traditionally worn in town men also sought a similar alternative to the formal evening tailcoat then known as a dress coat worn every eveningthe earliest record of a tailless coat being worn with evening wear is an 1865 midnight blue smoking jacket in silk with matching trousers ordered by the prince of wales later edward vii of the united kingdom from savile row tailors henry poole co the smoking jacket was tailored for use at sandringham the british royal familys informal country estate henry poole never saw his design become known as a dinner jacket or cross the atlantic and be called a tuxedo over there he died in 1876 leaving behind a wellrespected business to be run by his cousin samuel cundeyother accounts of the princes experimentation appear around 1885 referring variously to a garment of many colours such as was worn by our ancestors and short garments coming down to the waist and made on the model of the military mens jackets the suit jacket with tailcoat finishes as is most commonly known was first described around the same time and often associated with cowes a seaside resort in southern england and centre of british yachting that was closely associated with the prince it was originally intended for warm weather use but soon spread to informal or stag winter occasions as it was simply an evening tailcoat substitute it was worn with all the same accoutrements as the tailcoat including the trousers as such in these early days black tie in contrast to formal white tie was considered informal wearin the following decades of the victorian era the style became known as a dinner jacket a fashionable formal alternative for the tailcoat which men of the upper classes wore every evening thus it was worn with the standard accompaniments for the evening tailcoat at the time matching trousers white or black waistcoat white bow tie white detachable wingcollar formal shirt and black formal shoes lapels were often faced or edged in silk or satin in varying widths in comparison with a full dress such as a cutaway tailcoat etiquette guides declared dinner jacket inappropriate for wear in mixed company meaning together with ladiesduring the edwardian era the practice of wearing a black waistcoat and black bow tie with a dinner jacket became the convention establishing the basis of the current black tie and white tie dress codes the dinner jacket was also increasingly accepted at less formal evening occasions such as warmweather gatherings or intimate dinners with friendsafter world war i the dinner jacket became established as a semiformal evening wear while the evening tailcoat was limited to the most formal or ceremonial occasions during this interwar period doublebreasted jackets turndowncollar shirts and cummerbunds became popular for black tie evenings as white jackets were experimented with in warm weather since then black tie is often referred to as being semiformalin the decades following the world war ii black tie became special occasion attire rather than standard evening wear in the 1950s some experimented with coloured and patterned jackets cummerbunds and bow ties the 1960s and 1970s saw the colour palette move from muted to bright dayglow and pastel as well as ruffledplacket shirts as lapels got wider and piping was revived the 1980s and 1990s saw a return to traditional styles with black jackets and trousers again becoming nearly universal some insist the 21st century has seen increased variation and a relaxation of previous strict standards midnight blue once again became popular and lapel facings were sometimes reduced to wide edgingthe earliest references to a dress coat substitute in america are from the summer and fall of 1886 and like the british references from this time vary between waistlength messjacket style and the conventional suit jacket style the most famous reference originates from tuxedo park an upstate new york countryside enclave for manhattans wealthiest citizens a son of one of the communitys founders griswold lorillard and his friends were widely reported in society columns for showing up at the clubs first autumn ball in october 1886 wearing a tailless dress coat although it is not known whether this garment was a mess jacket or a conventional dinner jacket it has no doubt cemented the tailcoat substitutes association with tuxedo park in the mind of the publican essay in the tuxedo park archives attributes the jackets importation to america to resident james brown potter a merchant banker who had worked in london for brown brothers however this claim for potter can not be verified through independent sources period newspaper accounts indicate that at first the jacket was worn by young mavericks to gatherings considered strictly formal this led the american establishment to reject it out of hand it was only by 1888 that polite society accepted its role solely as summer and informal evening substitute at which point it became very popularthe earliest dinner jackets were of the same black material as the dress coat with one two or no buttons and a shawl collar faced in satin or ribbed silk by the turn of the twentieth century the peaked lapel was equally popular and the onebutton model had become standard when trousers were sold with the jacket they were of the same material edwardian dandies often opted for oxford grey or a very dark blue for their evening wearby world war i the grey option had fallen out of favor but the midnight blue alternative became increasingly popular and rivalled black by the mid1930s notch lapels imported from the ordinary business suit were a brief vogue in the 1920s a single stripe of braid covering the outseam on each leg was an occasional variation at first but became standard by the 1930s at this time doublebreasted jackets and white jackets became popular for wear in hot weathercolour texture and pattern became increasingly popular in warmweather jackets in the 1950s in the 1960s these variations became increasingly common regardless of season or climate notch lapels were once again a fad by the 1970s massmarket retailers began offering white and coloured versions of the entire suit to its rental customers the 1980s vogue for nostalgic and retro styles returned evening wear to its black tone notch lapels returned for good in the 1980s and in the 1990s tuxedo jackets increasingly took on other traits of the business suit such as two and threebutton styling flap pockets and centre vents these trends have continued into the early 21st century and midnight blue is now once again a popular alternativethe dinner suits accompaniments have also evolved over time the most traditional interpretations of these elements — dress shirt low cut waistcoat in the v or u shape black bow tie oxford dress shoes — are incorporated in the black tie dress codeunlike white tie which is very strictly regulated black tie ensembles can display more variation more extensively the traditional components for men arethe original and most formal model of dinner jacket is the singlebreasted model the typical black tie jacket is singlebreasted with one button only with jetted or besom pockets and is of black or midnight blue usually of wool or a woolmohair or woolpolyester blend although other materials especially silk are seen although other materials are used the most appropriate and traditional for the dinner jacket are wool barathea or superfine herringbone doublebreasted models have become less common but are generally considered equally appropriate for most black tie occasions dinner jackets were commonly ventless before world war i but in the 21st century come ventless with side vents or less commonly with centre vents the ventless style is considered more formal whilst the centre vent is the least formal the lapels traditionally pointed and shawl are usually faced with silk in either a grosgrain or a satin weave but can also be silk barathea a notched lapel is usually considered more appropriate for a business suit than a dinner jacket but is commonly seen on inexpensive off the rack dinner jackets according to the black tie guide the peaked lapel and shawl collar are equally authentic and correct with the latter being slightly less formal the buttons are covered in similarly coloured material to the main part of the jacket which would typically be either selffaced or covered with the same material as the lapels some higherend singlebreasted jackets both new and vintage tend to be fastened with a link front closure which is visually similar to a cufflink this traditional method of closure is common in the united kingdomthe doublebesomed jetted or slit hip pocket is the only style understated enough to complement the dinner jacket flap pockets are not considered appropriate for formal attires refined minimalism due to their busier and bulkier design and some believe that they are simply an attempt by dinner jacket manufacturers to save money by using standard suit patterns although sometimes they will trim the edges of a flap pocket so that the flap can be tucked in or removed if desired besom welts can be of self fabric or trimmed with the lapels silk facing though classic menswear scholar nicholas antongiavanni suggests that for the english this latter touch is a sure sign of hired clothes the dinner jacket also has a welt breast pocket to hold a pocket handkerchief which is generally selffaced rather than covered with silkemily post a resident of tuxedo park new york stated in 1909 that can have lapels or be shawlshaped in either case they are to have facings of silk satin or grosgrain she later republished this statement in her 1922 book etiquette adding that only singlebreasted jackets are appropriately called tuxedos there is a fashion movement suggesting that a mans appearance when wearing the wider and higher peak lapel is superior to the narrower notch lapelwhite dinner jackets are often worn in warm climates they are ivory in colour rather than pure white and have selffaced lapels ie made of the same fabric as the jacket rather than silkfaced lapels they are generally worn with the same types of shirts and accessories as black dinner jackets though the turndown collar and cummerbund preferred to the wing collar or waistcoat similarly the shawl lapel is more common in white dinner jackets in the united kingdom the 20thcentury etiquette was that white dinner jackets are never worn even on the hottest day of summer but are reserved for wear abroad in the 21st century white dinner jackets are frequently seen at weddings formal beach events and highschool proms in the united states and at some concerts famously for instance the last night of the proms in the united kingdom in tropical climates such as in imperial burma the desert fawn was historically used as the less formal colour at one time the civilian mess jacket was also an option in warmer climatesit is generally considered inappropriate for a man to remove his jacket during a formal social event but when hot weather and humidity dictate the ranking man of the royal family or the guest of honour may give men permission by noticeably taking off his jacket in anticipated hot weather red sea rig is specified in the invitation although this dress is esoteric in civilian circles and is particular to certain expatriate communitiestraditionally the only neckwear appropriate is the black bow tie that is a selftie and always matches the lapel facing of the dinner jacket and braiding of the trouser seams the bow tie is tied using a common shoelace knot which is also called the bow knot for that reasonblack tie trousers traditionally have no turnups also called cuffs in american english or belt loops the outer seams are usually decorated with a single braid of silk or a material that matches or complements the lapel facing traditionally braces called suspenders in us english hidden by the waistcoat are used to support the trousers belts are never worn with black tie trousers evening trousers may be flatfronted or pleated with pleats first coming into fashion in the 1930s whilst flatfronted trousers have become more fashionable pleated trousers may be considered more comfortable by men who have wider hips and a narrow waista waist covering is generally worn as part of a black tie ensemble either a low cut waistcoat or cummerbund may be worn but never both at the same time although the english authority debretts consider that wearing a waistcoat is smart they no longer consider either waist covering to be essential the american authority the emily post institute considers them to be an essential component of proper black tie attire waist coverings are not matched to wedding theme coloursa low cut waistcoat should be worn when wearing a singlebreasted coat the waistcoat plays an important part in black ties refined minimalism by helping to conceal its working parts by discreetly covering the trousers exposed waistband and the shirt bosoms bottom edge waistcoats come in the v or rarer u shape in backless or fully backed versions double or singlebreasted with or without lapels singlebreasted styles typically have three buttons and doublebreasted ones three or four rows before world war ii while black tie was still gaining acceptance men would wear a white waistcoat along with other details now associated primarily with white tie such as stiff fronted shirts however this style though increasingly viewed as an affectation is still acceptable in the united states the waistcoat may be made from either the same fabric as the dinner jacket as is traditional or the same silk as the jackets lapels which is more popular when a waistcoat has lapels they are faced in the same silk as those of the jacket in this case it is considered more refined if the body is made from the same fabric as the jacket the buttons may be selffaced or covered in the same silk as the lapels vintage waistcoats were sometimes closed with studs made from onyx or motherofpearl which were often surrounded by a setting of silver or golda waistcoat is never worn with a doublebreasted jacket since this style of jacket is never unbuttoned the waist of the trousers is never exposed and therefore does not need to be covered though before world war ii an edge of the waistcoat was often shown between the jacket and shirta cummerbund may be worn with a dinner jacket in lieu of a waistcoat and although it is considered slightly less formal it is equally correct it looks especially well with a shawl collar dinner jacket but may be worn in conjunction with peak lapels the material of the cummerbund should be silk satin grosgrain also called faille or barathea to match that of the bow tie it features upwardfacing folds which were originally used to store theatre or opera tickets and are now considered to be more decorative than functional just like the waistcoat cummerbunds are not worn with a doublebreasted jacketas the cummerbund is seen as an extension of the trousers traditionally it is the same colour ie black however the black tie guide endorses deep and rich colours as a tasteful way to introduce some colour into an outfit that is otherwise monochromatic bright colours such as those often worn by members of wedding parties should be avoided and the bow tie must remain black in any case some higher quality models feature a hidden pocket and an elastic loop to fasten to the trousersdress shirts designed to be worn with black tie are sometimes called tuxedo shirts in american english traditionally the shirt is white has a bibbed front that is either marcella or pleated a turndown collar and double or french cuffs in the early20th century a piqué shirt with a detachable wing collar and single cuffs such as is worn with white tie was used and in the 1960s and 1970s ruffled bibs were popular but have since become uncommon the wing collar originally disappeared in black tie after the 1920s when the appropriately semiformal attached turndown collar shirt became preferred but it has been popular with american men in a less substantial attached form since the 1980s however many style authorities argue that the wing collar should remain the domain of white tie for aesthetic reasons etiquette maven miss manners is one of those who feel that while the bow ties uncovered band is fine in a whiteonwhite scheme gentlemen with their black ties exposed allaround their necks look sillyalthough some style authorities consider the wing collar to be an acceptable option for black tie shirts they are not worn with double cuffs or a pleated bib and are better suited to the more formal singlebreasted peak lapel jacket they may feature a bib that is either marcella or starched and include stiff single cuffs secured with cufflinks made of the same fabric as the bib this type of shirt is exactly the same as one worn with white tie attire the collar in this case is tall and stiff which may be attached or detachable when a full dress shirt is worn in this fashion it is accompanied by the white marcella waistcoat ordinarily associated with white tie wearing white tie accessories in this manner is considered by many to be an affectation debretts do not endorse the wing collar as being compatible with the black tie dress codethe more formal marcella version of the shirt fastens with matching shirt studs these are most commonly in silver or gold settings featuring onyx or motherofpearl various geometrical shapes are worn eg circles which are most common for studs octagons or rectangles which are most common for cufflinks there has been no consistent fashion preference for gold or silver but studs with motherofpearl are more formal and therefore often associated with white tie the softfront pleated version of the shirt should be fastened with motherofpearl buttons typically supplied with the shirt on a separate strip of fabric alternatively a flyfront shirt appropriate with both the marcella and pleated bibs conceals the placket for a more minimalistic lookthere are several types of cufflinks that may be worn with black tie the most formal and decorative are the doublepanel type which dress both sides of the cuff and are connected by a chain or link of metal this model conceals the mechanism by which the cuff is secured the most common and least decorative are the swivel bar type whilst these are acceptable they leave the inner side of the cuffs and mechanism exposed which is incongruous with formal dressthe most formal and traditional shoes are patent leather opera pumps also called court shoes decorated with grosgrain bows the more popular alternative is the black laceup oxford shoe in patent leather or calfskin with a rounded plain toe brogueing or any other decorative patterns should never be seen on black tie footwear matte finish pumps are also seen shoes are almost invariably black and patent leather is considered more formal than matte finishes while pumps are considered more formal than laceups generally considered too informal for black tie are shoes with open lacing such as the derby shoe called bluchers in american english notable alternatives include the black button boot primarily of historical interest only and the monogrammed albert slipper which was originally worn only at home hosiery is black socks made from fine wool or silkmost etiquette and fashion guides of the current decade recommend keeping colour touches and favouring a single colour usually dark muted reds such as maroon are a traditional choicehandkerchief a handkerchief in linen traditionally or silk or cotton is usually worn in the breast pocket although precedents for tasteful exceptions exist pocket squares are normally white and may not match the waist covering or bow tieboutonnière a flower may be worn red and white carnation blue cornflower and rosebud have all been popular at times in france the boutonnière is usually a gardeniaouterwear black tie events do not involve outerwear and coats and gloves are no longer considered part of the dress code however etiquette for what to wear in public in transit to and from black tie occasions was stiffer in earlier eras and remain an option matching overcoats are usually black charcoal or dark blue and traditionally of the chesterfield style a guards coat was also once popular and a lighter topcoat can be worn in summer historically an inverness coat was also worn until the mid20th century gloves and scarves were always worn and are still occasionally seen in grey leather and white silk respectively white kid gloves have never been standard with black tie remaining exclusive to white tie dresshat the 20thcentury standard hat for black tie was a black or midnight blue homburg in winter or straw boater in spring and summer fedoras were originally regarded as too informal but have become more common top hats were originally worn with black tie but had

implies evening dress for women in 1966 famous couturier yves saint laurent proposed le smoking a dinner suit designed for women most initial reactions to the collection were negative the designer took bits and pieces from both mens suit and womens clothing and combined it with new ideas as this dinner suit was designed for women it was different from the normal male dinner suit the collar was more feminine as the shape and curve were more subtle the waistline of the blouse was narrowed to show the body shape and pants were adjusted to help elongate the leg it pioneered long minimalist androgynous styles for women as well as the female use of power suits and the pantsuit in modernday society some described saint laurents initiative as empowerment of women by giving them the option to wear clothes that were normally worn by men with influence and power fashion photography echoes the influence of this suit in shoots that feature androgynous models with slickedback hair in a mannish threepiece suit a style that was first popularized in photographs by helmut newton this suit has continued to influence fashion designers collections through the 2000sin traditional western
