complications from a mumps infectionon july 31 1964 reeves and his business partner and manager dean manuel also the pianist of reevess backing group the blue boys left batesville arkansas en route to nashville in a singleengine beechcraft debonair aircraft n8972m with reeves at the controls the two had secured a deal on some real estatewhile flying over brentwood tennessee they approached a violent thunderstorm a subsequent investigation showed that once the small airplane became caught in the storm reeves suffered spatial disorientation the singers widow mary reeves 1929–1999 probably unwittingly started the rumor that he was flying the airplane upside down and assumed he was increasing altitude to clear the storm however according to larry jordan author of the 2011 biography jim reeves his untold story this scenario is rebutted by eyewitnesses known to crash investigators who saw the plane overhead immediately before the mishap and confirmed that reeves was not upside downreeves friend musician marty robbins recalled hearing the wreck happen and alerting authorities to which direction he heard the impact jordan writes extensively about forensic evidence including from the longelusive tower tape and accident report which suggests that instead of making a right turn to avoid the storm as he had been advised by the approach controller to do reeves turned left in an attempt to follow franklin road to the airport in so doing he flew further into the rain while preoccupied with trying to reestablish his ground references reeves let his airspeed get too low and stalled the aircraft relying on his instincts more than his training evidence suggests he applied full power and pulled back on the yoke before leveling his wings—a fatal but not uncommon mistake that induced a stallspin from which he was too low to recover jordan writes that according to the tower tape reeves ran into the heavy rain at 451 pm and crashed only a minute laterwhen the wreckage was found some 42 hours later the airplanes engine and nose was discovered buried in the ground due to the impact of the crash the crash site was in a wooded area northnortheast of brentwood roughly at the junction of baxter lane and franklin pike circle just east of interstate 65 and southwest of nashville international airport where reeves planned to landon the morning of august 2 1964 after an intense search by several parties which included several personal friends of reeves among them ernest tubb and marty robbins the bodies of the singer and dean manuel were found in the wreckage of the aircraft and at 100 pm local time radio stations across the united states began to announce reeves death formally thousands of people traveled to pay their last respects at his funeral two days later
