i wouldnt be where i am today those guys were the inspiration that got me going if it wasnt for that kind of music i couldnt do what im doing nowhis fathers record collection exposed him to various musical genres such as the blues of muddy waters the gospel of mahalia jackson the jazz of charlie parker the folk music of woody guthrie and country music from hank williams and jimmie rodgers while the first record he ever bought was by blues musician sonny terry when lonnie donegan had a hit with rock island line written by huddie ledbetter lead belly morrison felt he was familiar with and able to connect with skiffle music as he had been hearing lead belly before thatmorrisons father bought him his first acoustic guitar when he was 11 and he learned to play rudimentary chords from the song book the carter family style edited by alan lomax in 1957 at the age of twelve morrison formed his first band a skiffle group the sputniks named after the satellite sputnik 1 that had been launched in october of that year by the soviet union in 1958 the band played at some of the local cinemas and morrison took the lead contributing most of the singing and arranging other shortlived groups followed – at 14 he formed midnight special another modified skiffle band and played at a school concert then when he heard jimmy giuffre playing saxophone on the train and the river he talked his father into buying him a tenor saxophone and took saxophone and music reading lessons from jazz musician george cassidy who morrison saw as a big inspiration and they became friends he also grew up with him on hyndford street now playing the saxophone morrison joined with various local bands including one called deanie sands and the javelins with whom he played guitar and shared singing the lineup of the band was lead vocalist deanie sands guitarist george jones and drummer and vocalist roy kane later the four main musicians of the javelins with the addition of wesley black as pianist became known as the monarchsmorrison attended orangefield boys secondary school leaving in july 1960 with no qualifications as a member of a workingclass community he was expected to get a regular fulltime job so after several short apprenticeship positions he settled into a job as a window cleaner—later alluded to in his songs cleaning windows and saint dominics preview however he had been developing his musical interests from an early age and continued playing with the monarchs parttime young morrison also played with the harry mack showband the great eight with his older workplace friend geordie g d sproule whom he later named as one of his biggest influencesat age 17 morrison toured europe for the first time with the monarchs now calling themselves the international monarchs this irish showband with morrison playing saxophone guitar and harmonica in addition to backup duty on bass and drums toured seamy clubs and us army bases in scotland england and germany often playing five sets a night while in germany the band recorded a single boozoo hully gullytwingy baby under the name georgie and the monarchs this was morrisons first recording taking place in november 1963 at ariola studios in cologne with morrison on saxophone it made the lower reaches of the german chartsupon returning to belfast in november 1963 the group disbanded so morrison connected with geordie sproule again and played with him in the manhattan showband along with guitarist herbie armstrong when armstrong auditioned to play with brian rossi and the golden eagles later known as the wheels morrison went along and was hired as a blues singerthe roots of them the band that first broke morrison on the international scene came in april 1964 when he responded to an advert for musicians to play at a new rb club at the maritime hotel in college square north – an old belfast hostel frequented by sailors the new club needed a band for its opening night morrison had left the golden eagles the group with which he had been performing at the time so he created a new band out of the gamblers an east belfast group formed by ronnie millings billy harrison and alan henderson in 1962 eric wrixon still a schoolboy was the piano player and keyboardist morrison played saxophone and harmonica and shared vocals with billy harrison they followed eric wrixons suggestion for a new name and the gamblers morphed into them their name taken from the horror movie themthe bands rb performances at the maritime attracted attention them performed without a routine and morrison ad libbed creating his songs live as he performed while the band did covers they also played some of morrisons early songs such as could you would you which he had written in camden town while touring with the manhattan showband the debut of morrisons gloria took place on stage here sometimes depending on his mood the song could last up to twenty minutes morrison has said them lived and died on the stage at the maritime hotel believing the band did not manage to capture the spontaneity and energy of their live performances on their records the statement also reflected the instability of the them lineup with numerous members passing through the ranks after the definitive maritime period morrison and henderson remained the only constants and a less successful version of them soldiered on after morrisons departuredick rowe of decca records became aware of the bands performances and signed them to a standard twoyear contract in that period they released two albums and ten singles with two more singles released after morrison departed the band they had three chart hits baby please dont go 1964 here comes the night 1965 and mystic eyes 1965 but it was the bside of baby please dont go the garage band classic gloria that went on to become a rock standard covered by patti smith the doors the shadows of knight jimi hendrix and many othersbuilding on the success of their singles in the united states and riding on the back of the british invasion them undertook a twomonth tour of america in may and june 1966 that included a residency from 30 may to 18 june at the whisky a go go in los angeles the doors were the supporting act on the last week and morrisons influence on the doors singer jim morrison was noted by john densmore in his book riders on the storm brian hinton relates how jim morrison learned quickly from his near namesakes stagecraft his apparent recklessness his air of subdued menace the way he would improvise poetry to a rock beat even his habit of crouching down by the bass drum during instrumental breaks on the final night the two morrisons and the two bands jammed together on gloriatoward the end of the tour the band members became involved in a dispute with their manager decca records phil solomon over the revenues paid to them that coupled with the expiry of their work visas meant the band returned from america dejected after two more concerts in ireland them split up morrison concentrated on writing some of the songs that would appear on astral weeks while the remnants of the band reformed in 1967 and relocated to americabert berns thems producer and composer of their 1965 hit here comes the night persuaded morrison to return to new york to record solo for his new label bang records morrison flew over and signed a contract he had not fully studied during a twoday recording session at a r studios starting 28 march 1967 he recorded eight songs originally intended to be used as four singles instead these songs were released as the album blowin your mind without morrisons consultation he said he only became aware of the albums release when a friend mentioned that he had bought a copy morrison was unhappy with the album and said he had a different concept of itbrown eyed girl one of the songs from blowin your mind was released as a single in midjune 1967 reaching number ten in the us charts brown eyed girl became morrisons mostplayed song the song spent a total of sixteen weeks on the chart it is considered to be morrisons signature song an evaluation in 2015 of downloads since 2004 and airplay since 2010 had brown eyed girl as the most popular song of

ranked no 110 on the rolling stone magazine list of 500 greatest songs of all time in january 2007 brown eyed girl was inducted into the grammy hall of famefollowing the death of berns in 1967 morrison became involved in a contract dispute with berns widow ilene berns that prevented him from performing on stage or recording in the new york area the song big time operators released in 1993 is thought to allude to his dealings with the new york music business during this period he moved to boston massachusetts and faced personal and financial problems he had slipped into a malaise and had trouble finding concert bookings he regained his professional footing through the few gigs he could find and started recording with warner bros recordswarner bros bought out morrisons bang contract with a 20000 cash transaction that took place in an abandoned warehouse on ninth avenue in manhattan a clause required morrison to submit 36 original songs within a year to berns music publishing company he recorded them in one session on an outoftune guitar with lyrics about subjects including ringworm and sandwiches ilene berns thought the songs were nonsense and did not use them the throwaway compositions came to be known as the revenge songs and did not see official release until the 2017 compilation the authorized bang collectionmorrisons first album for warner bros records was astral weeks which he had already performed in several clubs around boston a mystical song cycle often considered to be his best work and one of the best albums of all time morrison has said when astral weeks came out i was starving literally released in 1968 the album originally received an indifferent response from the public but it eventually achieved critical acclaimthe album is described by allmusics william ruhlmann as hypnotic meditative and as possessing a unique musical power it has been compared to french impressionism and mystical celtic poetry a 2004 rolling stone magazine review begins with the words this is music of such enigmatic beauty that thirtyfive years after its release astral weeks still defies easy admiring description alan light later described astral weeks as like nothing he had done previously—and really nothing anyone had done previously morrison sings of lost love death and nostalgia for childhood in the celtic soul that would become his signature it has been placed on many lists of best albums of all time in the 1995 mojo list of 100 best albums it was listed as number two and was number nineteen on the rolling stone magazines the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2003 in december 2009 it was voted the top irish album of all time by a poll of leading irish musicians conducted by hot press magazinemorrisons third solo album moondance which was released in 1970 became his first million selling album and reached number twentynine on the billboard charts the style of moondance stood in contrast to that of astral weeks whereas astral weeks had a sorrowful and vulnerable tone moondance restored a more optimistic and cheerful message to his music which abandoned the previous records abstract folk compositions in favour of more formally composed songs and a lively rhythm and blues style he expanded on throughout his careerthe title track although not released in the us as a single until 1977 received heavy play in fm radio formats into the mystic has also gained a wide following over the years come running which reached the american top 40 rescued morrison from what seemed then as hot 100 obscurity moondance was both well received and favourably reviewed lester bangs and greil marcus had a combined fullpage review in rolling stone saying morrison now had the striking imagination of a consciousness that is visionary in the strongest sense of the word that was the type of band i dig morrison said of the moondance sessions two horns and a rhythm section—theyre the type of bands that i like best he produced the album himself as he felt like nobody else knew what he wanted moondance was listed at number sixtyfive on the rolling stone magazines the 500 greatest albums of all time in march 2007 moondance was listed as number seventytwo on the narm rock and roll hall of fame list of the definitive 200over the next few years he released a succession of albums starting with a second one in 1970 his band and the street choir had a freer more relaxed sound than moondance but not the perfection in the opinion of critic jon landau who felt like a few more numbers with a gravity of street choir would have made this album as perfect as anyone could have stood it contained the hit single domino which charted at number nine in the billboard hot 100in 1971 he released another wellreceived album tupelo honey this album produced the hit single wild night that was later covered by john mellencamp and meshell ndegeocello the title song has a notably countrysoul feel about it and the album ended with another country tune moonshine whiskey morrison said he originally intended to make an allcountry album the recordings were as live as possible—after rehearsing the songs the musicians would enter the studio and play a whole set in one take his coproducer ted templeman described this recording process as the scariest thing ive ever seen when hes got something together he wants to put it down right away with no overdubbingreleased in 1972 saint dominics preview revealed morrisons break from the more accessible style of his previous three albums and moving back towards the more daring adventurous and meditative aspects of astral weeks the combination of two styles of music demonstrated a versatility not previously found in his earlier albums two songs jackie wilson said im in heaven when you smile and redwood tree reached the hot 100 singles chart the songs listen to the lion and almost independence day are each over ten minutes long and employ the type of poetic imagery not heard since astral weeks it was his highestcharting album in the us until his top ten debut on billboard 200 in 2008he released his next album hard nose the highway in 1973 receiving mixed but mostly negative reviews the album contained the popular song warm love but otherwise has been largely dismissed critically in a 1973 rolling stone review it was described as psychologically complex musically somewhat uneven and lyrically excellentduring a threeweek vacation visit to ireland in october 1973 morrison wrote seven of the songs that made up his next album veedon fleece though it attracted scant initial attention its critical stature grew markedly over the years—with veedon fleece now often considered to be one of morrisons most impressive and poetic works in a 2008 rolling stone review andy greene writes that when released in late 1974 it was greeted by a collective shrug by the rock critical establishment and concludes hes released many wonderful albums since but hes never again hit the majestic heights of this one you dont pull no punches but you dont push the river one of the albums side closers exemplifies the long hypnotic cryptic morrison with its references to visionary poet william blake and to the seemingly graillike veedon fleece objectmorrison took three years to release a followup album after a decade without taking time off he said in an interview he needed to get away from music completely and ceased listening to it for several months also suffering from writers block he seriously considered leaving the music business for good speculation that an extended jam session would be released either under the title mechanical bliss or naked in the jungle or stiff upper lip came to nothing and morrisons next album was a period of transition in 1977 a collaboration with dr john who had appeared at the last waltz concert with morrison in 1976 the album received a mild critical reception and marked the beginning of a very prolific period of songmakinginto the music the albums last four songs angelou and the healing has begun and its all in the gameyou know what theyre writing about are a veritable tourdeforce with morrison summoning every vocal trick at his disposal from angelous climactic shouts to the sexuallycharged halfmumbled monologue in and the healing has begun to the barely audible whisper that is the albums final soundscott thomas reviewthe following year morrison released wavelength it became at that time the fastestselling album of his career and soon went gold the title track became a modest hit peaking at number fortytwo making use of 1970s synthesisers it mimics the sounds of the shortwave radio stations he listened to in his youth the opening track kingdom hall—the name given by jehovahs witnesses to their places of worship—evoked morrisons childhood experiences of religion with his mother and foretold the religious themes that were more evident on his next album into the musicconsidered by allmusic as the definitive postclassicera morrison into the music was released in the last year of the 1970s songs on this album for the first time alluded to the healing power of music which became an abiding interest of morrisons bright side of the road was a joyful uplifting song that is featured on the soundtrack of the movie michaelwith his next album the new decade found morrison following his muse into uncharted territory and sometimes merciless reviews in february 1980 morrison and a group of musicians travelled to super bear a studio in the french alps to record on the site of a former abbey what is considered to be the most controversial album in his discography later morrison admitted his original concept was even more esoteric than the final product the album common one consisted of six songs the longest summertime in england lasted fifteen and a half minutes and ended with the words can you feel the silence nme magazines paul du noyer called the album colossally smug and cosmically dull an interminable vacuous and drearily egotistical stab at spirituality into the muzak greil marcus whose previous writings had been favourably inclined towards morrison critically remarked its van acting the part of the mystic poet he thinks hes supposed to be morrison insisted the album was never meant to be a commercial album biographer clinton heylin concludes he would not attempt anything so ambitious again henceforth every radical idea would be tempered by some notion of commerciality later critics reassessed the album more favourably with the success of summertime in england lester bangs wrote in 1982 van was making holy music even though he thought he was and us rock critics had made our usual mistake of paying too much attention to the lyricsmorrisons next album beautiful vision released in 1982 had him returning once again to the music of his northern irish roots well received by the critics and public it produced a minor uk hit single cleaning windows that referenced one of morrisons first jobs after leaving school several other songs on the album vanlose stairway she gives me religion and the instrumental scandinavia show the presence of a new personal muse in his life a danish public relations agent who would share morrisons spiritual interests and serve as a steadying influence on him throughout most of the 1980s scandinavia with morrison on piano was nominated in the best rock instrumental performance category for the 25th annual grammy awardsmuch of the music morrison released throughout the 1980s continued to focus on the themes of spirituality and faith his 1983 album inarticulate speech of the heart was a move towards creating music for meditation with synthesisers uilleann pipes and flute sounds and four of the tracks were instrumentals the titling of the album and the presence of the instrumentals were noted to be indicative of morrisons longheld belief that its not the words one uses but the force of conviction behind those words that matters during this period of time morrison had studied scientology and gave special thanks to l ron hubbard on the albums creditsa sense of wonder morrisons 1985 album pulled together the spiritual themes contained in his last four albums which were defined in a rolling stone review as rebirth into the music deep contemplation and meditation common one ecstasy and humility beautiful vision and blissful mantra like languor inarticulate speech of the heart the single tore down a la rimbaud was a reference to rimbaud and an earlier bout of writers block that morrison had encountered in 1974 in 1985 morrison also wrote the musical score for the movie lamb starring liam neesonmorrisons 1986 release no guru no method no teacher was said to contain a genuine holiness and musical freshness that needs to be set in context to understand critical response was favourable with a sounds reviewer calling the album his most intriguingly involved since astral weeks and morrison at his most mystical magical best it contains the song in the garden that according to morrison had a definite meditation process which is a form of transcendental meditation as its basis its not tm he entitled the album as a rebuttal to media attempts to place him in various creeds in an interview in the observer he told anthony denselowthere have been many lies put out about me and this finally states my position i have never joined any organisation nor plan to i am not affiliated to any guru dont subscribe to any method and for those people who dont know what a guru is i dont have a teacher eitherafter releasing the no guru album morrisons music appeared less gritty and more adult contemporary with the wellreceived 1987 album poetic champions compose considered to be one of his recording highlights of the 1980s the romantic ballad from this album someone like you has been featured subsequently in the soundtracks of several movies including 1995s french kiss and in 2001 both someone like you and bridget joness diaryin 1988 he released irish heartbeat a collection of traditional irish folk songs recorded with the irish group the chieftains which reached number 18 in the uk album charts the title song irish heartbeat was originally recorded on his 1983 album inarticulate speech of the heartthe 1989 album avalon sunset which featured the hit duet with cliff richard whenever god shines his light and the ballad have i told you lately on which earthly love transmutes into that for god hinton reached 13 on the uk album chart although considered to be a deeply spiritual album it also contained daring night which deals with full blazing sex whatever its churchy organ and gentle lilt suggesthinton morrisons familiar themes of god woman his childhood in belfast and those enchanted moments when time stands still were prominent in the songs he can be heard calling out the change of tempo at the end of this song repeating the numbers 1–4 to cue the chord changes the first and fourth chord in the key of the music he often completed albums in two days frequently releasing first takesthe early to middle 1990s were commercially successful for morrison with three

morrison released the healing game the album received mixed reviews with the lyrics being described as tired and dull though critic greil marcus praised the musical complexity of the album by saying it carries the listener into a musical home so perfect and complete he or she might have forgotten that music could call up such a place and then populate it with people acts wishes fears the following year morrison finally released some of his previously unissued studio recordings in a twodisc set the philosophers stone his next release 1999s back on top achieved modest success being his

for nearly ten years morrison began experiencing stage fright when performing for audiences of thousands as opposed to the hundreds he had experienced in his early career he became anxious on stage and had difficulty establishing eye contact with the audience he once said in an interview about performing on stage i dig singing the songs but there are times when its pretty agonising for me to be out there after a brief break from music he started appearing in clubs regaining his ability to perform live albeit with smaller audiencesthe 1974 live double album its too late to stop now has been called one of the greatest recordings of a live concert and has appeared on lists of greatest live albums of all time biographer johnny rogan wrote morrison was in the midst of what was arguably his greatest phase as a performer performances on the album were from tapes made during a threemonth tour of the us and europe in 1973 with the backing group the caledonia soul orchestra soon after recording the album morrison restructured the caledonia soul orchestra into a smaller unit the caledonia soul expresson thanksgiving day 1976 morrison performed at the farewell concert for the band it was his first live performance in several years and he considered skipping his appearance until the last minute even refusing to go on stage when they announced his name his manager harvey goldsmith said he literally kicked him out there morrison was on good terms with the members of the band as nearneighbours in woodstock and they had the shared experience of stage fright at the concert he performed two songs his first was a rendition of the classic irish song too ra loo ra loo ral his second song was caravan from his 1970 album moondance greil marcus in attendance at the concert wrote van morrison turned the show around singing to the rafters and burning holes in the floor it was a triumph and as the song ended van began to kick his leg into the air out of sheer exuberance and he kicked his way right offstage like a rockette the crowd had given him a fine welcome and they cheered wildly when he left the filmed concert served as the basis for martin scorseses 1978 film the last waltzduring his association with the band morrison acquired the nicknames belfast cowboy and van the man on the bands album cahoots as part of the duet 4 pantomime that morrison sings with richard

1995 his song days like this had become the official anthem for the northern irish peace movementvan morrison continued performing concerts throughout the year rather than touring playing few of his bestknown songs in concert he has firmly resisted relegation to a nostalgia act during a 2006 interview he told paul sextoni dont really tour this is another misconception i stopped touring in the true sense of the word in the late 1970s early 1980s possibly i just do gigs now i average two gigs a week only in america do i do more because you cant really do a couple of gigs there so i do more

morrison played one of the first bigscale concerts in london since events albeit tentatively started up again will hodgkinson wrote that the show was as good an argument for the return of live music as you could wish forvan morrison has collaborated extensively with a variety of artists throughout his career he has worked with many legends in soul and blues including john lee hooker ray charles george benson eric clapton bobby womack and bb king along with the chieftains gregory porter michael bublé joss stone natalie cole and mark knopflermorrison and the internationally renowned irish folk band the chieftains recorded the album irish heartbeat 1988 consisting of irish folk songs it entered the uk top 20 whenever god shines his light on avalon sunset 1989 is a duet with cliff richard which charted at no 20 on the uk singles chart and no 3 on the irish singles chart allmusic critic jason ankeny found it to be a standout opener on the album for critic patrick humphries it was the most manifest example of morrisons christian commitment and while not one of morrisons most outstanding songs it works as a testament of faiththe decade saw an upsurge in van morrisons collaborations he developed a close association with two vocal talents at opposite ends of their careers georgie fame with whom morrison had already worked occasionally lent his voice and hammond organ skills to morrisons band and brian kennedys vocals complemented the grizzled voice of morrison both in studio and live performances he reunited with the chieftains on their 1995 album the long black veil with a reworking of morrisons song have i told you lately winning the grammy award for best pop collaboration with vocals he produced and was featured on several tracks with blues legend john lee hooker on

these blues alive on this album hooker also recorded a cover of morrisons tb sheets morrison collaborated with tom jones on his 1999 album reload when the pair sang on morrisons song sometimes we crymorrison delivered vocals on the last laugh on mark knopflers sailing to philadelphia 2000 and that year also recorded a classic country music duet album you win again with linda gail lewis the album received a threestar review from allmusic who called it a roots effort that never sounds studied in 2004 morrison was one of the guests on ray charles album genius loves company the pair performed morrisons crazy love in 2015 he recorded an album of collaborations duets reworking the catalogue which featured among others steve winwood taj mahal mavis staples mick hucknall and morrisons daughter shana morrison morrison also developed a partnership with joey defrancesco with the pair collaborating on a number of albums during the covid pandemic morrison recorded tracks with eric clapton criticizing harmreduction measuresit is at the heart of morrisons presence as a singer that when he lights on certain sounds certain small moments inside a song—hesitations silences shifts in pressure sudden entrances slamming doors—can then suggest whole territories completed stories indistinct ceremonies far outside anything that can be literally traced in the compositions that carry them–greil marcusfeaturing his characteristic growl—a mix of folk blues soul jazz gospel and ulster scots celtic influences—morrison is widely considered by many rock historians to be one of the most unusual and influential vocalists in the history of rock and roll critic greil marcus has said no white man sings like van morrison in his 2010 book marcus wrote as a physical fact morrison may have the richest and most expressive voice pop music has produced since elvis presley and with a sense of himself as an artist that elvis was always deniedas morrison began live performances of the 40yearold album astral weeks in 2008 there were comparisons to his youthful voice of 1968 his early voice was described as flinty and tender beseeching and plaintive forty years later the difference in his vocal range and power were noticeable but reviewers and critics comments were favourable morrisons voice has expanded to fill his frame a deeper louder roar than the blueeyed soul voice of his youth—softer on the diction—but none the less impressively powerful morrison also commented on the changes in his approach to singing the approach now is to sing from lower down so i do not ruin my voice before i sang in the upper area of my throat which tends to wreck the vocal cords over time singing from lower in the belly allows my resonance to carry far i can stand four feet from a mic and be heard quite resonantlymorrison has written hundreds of songs during his career with a recurring theme reflecting a nostalgic yearning for the carefree days of his childhood in belfast some of his song titles derive from familiar locations in his childhood such as cyprus avenue a nearby street orangefield the boys school he attended and on hyndford street where he was born also frequently present in morrisons best love songs is a blending of the sacredprofane as evidenced in into the mystic and so quiet in herebeginning with his 1979 album into the music and the song and the healing has begun a frequent theme of his music and lyrics has been based on his belief in the healing power of music combined with a form of mystic christianity this theme has become one of the predominant qualities of his workhis lyrics show the influence of the visionary poets william blake and w b yeats and others such as samuel taylor coleridge and william wordsworth biographer brian hinton believes like any great poet from blake to seamus heaney he takes words back to their origins in magic indeed morrison is returning poetry to its earliest roots—as in homer or old english epics like beowulf or the psalms or folk song—in all of which words and music combine to form a new reality another biographer john collis believes morrisons style of jazz singing and repeating phrases preclude his lyrics from being regarded as poetry or as collis asserts he is more likely to repeat a phrase like a mantra or burst into scat singing the words may often be prosaic and so can hardly be poetrymorrison has described his songwriting method by remarking i write from a different place i do not even know what it is called or if it has a name it just comes and i sculpt it but it is also a lot of hard work doing the sculptingvan morrison is interested obsessed with how much musical or verbal information he can compress into a small space and almost conversely how far he can spread one note word sound or picture to capture one moment be it a caress or a twitch he repeats certain phrases to extremes that from anybody else would seem ridiculous because hes waiting for a vision to unfold trying as unobtrusively as possible to nudge it along its the great search fuelled by the belief that through these musical and mental processes illumination is attainable or may at least be glimpsed–lester bangscritic greil marcus argues that given the truly distinctive breadth and complexity of morrisons work it is almost impossible to cast his work among that of others morrison remains a singer who can be compared to no other in the history of rock roll a singer who can not be pinned down dismissed or fitted into anyones expectations or in the words of jay cocks he extends himself only to express himself alone among rocks great figures—and even in that company he is one of the greatest—morrison is adamantly inward and unique although he freely crosses musical boundaries— rb celtic melodies jazz raveup rock hymns downanddirty blues—he can unfailingly be found in the same strange place on his own wavelengthhis spiritually themed style of music first came into full expression with astral weeks in 1968 and he was noted to have remained a master of his transcendental craft in 2009 while performing the astral weeks songs live this musical art form was based on stream of consciousness songwriting and emotional vocalising of lyrics that have no basis in normal structure or symmetry his live performances are dependent on building dynamics with spontaneity between himself and his band whom he controls with hand gestures throughout sometimes signalling impromptu solos from a selected band member the music and vocals build towards a hypnotic and trancelike state that depends on inthemoment creativity scott foundas with la weekly wrote he seeks to transcend the apparent boundaries of any given song to achieve a total freedom of form to take himself his band and the audience on a journey whose destination is anything but known greil marcus wrote an entire book devoted to examining the moments in morrisons music where he reaches this state of transcendence and explains but in his music the same sense of escape from ordinary limits—a reach for or the achievement of a kind of violent transcendence—can come from hesitations repetitions of words or phrases pauses the way a musical change by another musician is turned by morrison as a bandleader or seized on by him as a singer and changed into a sound that becomes an event in and of itself in these moments the self is left behind and the sound that yarragh becomes the active agent a musical person with its own mind its own body a book reviewer further described it as this transcendent moment of music when the song and the singer are one thing not two neither dependent on the other or separate from the other but melded to the other like one like breath and life morrison has said he believes in the jazz improvisational technique of never performing a song the same way twice and except for the unique rendition of the astral weeks songs live doesnt perform a concert from a preconceived set list morrison has said he prefers to perform at smaller venues or symphony halls noted for their good acoustics his ban against alcoholic beverages which made entertainment news during 2008 was an attempt to prevent the disruptive and distracting movement of audience members leaving their seats during the performances in a 2009 interview morrison stated i do not consciously aim to take the listener anywhere if anything i aim to take myself there in my music if the listener catches the wavelength of what i am saying or singing or gets whatever point whatever line means to them then i guess as a writer i may have done a days workthe music of van morrison has encompassed many genres since his early days as a blues and rb singer in belfast over the years he has recorded songs from a varying list of genres drawn from many influences and interests as well as blues and rb his compositions and covers have moved between pop music jazz rock folk country gospel irish folk and traditional big band skiffle rock and roll new age classical and sometimes spoken word coney island and instrumentals morrison defines himself as a soul singermorrisons music has been described by music journalist alan light as celtic soul or what biographer brian hinton referred to as a new alchemy called caledonian soul another biographer ritchie yorke quoted morrison as believing that he has the spirit of caledonia in his soul and his music reflects it according to yorke morrison claimed to have discovered a certain quality of soul when he first visited scotland his belfast ancestors were of ulster scots descent and morrison has said he believes there is some connection between soul music and caledonia yorke said morrison discovered several years after he first began composing music that some of his songs lent themselves to a unique major modal scale without sevenths which of course is the same scale as that used by bagpipe players and old irish and scottish folk musicthe name caledonia has played a prominent role in morrisons life and career biographer ritchie yorke had pointed out already by 1975 that morrison has referred to caledonia so many times in his career that he seems to be obsessed with the word in his 2009 biography erik hage found morrison seemed deeply interested in his paternal scottish roots during his early career and later in the ancient countryside of england hence his repeated use of the term caledonia an ancient roman name for scotlandnorthern britain as well as being his daughter shanas middle name it is the name of his first production company his studio his publishing company two of his backing groups his parents record store in fairfax california in the 1970s and he also recorded a cover of the song caldonia with the name spelt caledonia in 1974 morrison used caledonia in what has been called a quintessential van morrison moment in the song listen to the lion with the lyrics and we sail and we sail way up to caledonia morrison used caledonia as a mantra in the live performance of the song astral weeks recorded at the two hollywood bowl concerts as late as 2016s keep me singing album he recorded a selfpenned instrumental entitled caledonia swingmorrisons influence can readily be heard in the music of a diverse array of major artists according to the rolling stone encyclopedia of rock and roll simon schuster 2001 his influence among rock singerssong writers is unrivaled by any living artist outside of that other prickly legend bob dylan echoes of morrisons rugged literateness and his gruff feverish emotive vocals can be heard in latter day icons ranging from bruce springsteen to elvis costello he has influenced an array of top tier performers including u2 with bono recalling i am in awe of a musician like van morrison i had to stop listening to van morrison records about six months before we made the unforgettable fire because i didnt want his very original soul voice to overpower my own he has inspired john mellencamp wild night jim morrison joan armatrading the only musical influence she will acknowledge nick cave rod stewart tom petty rickie lee jones recognises both laura nyro

album a night in san francisco he had as his special guests among others his childhood idols jimmy witherspoon john lee hooker and junior wells although he often expresses his displeasure in interviews and songs with the music industry and the media in general he has been instrumental in promoting the careers of many other musicians and singers such as james hunter and fellow belfastborn brothers brian and bap kennedy he has also influenced the visual arts the german painter johannes heisig created a series of lithographs illustrating the book in the garden – for van morrison published by städtische galerie sonneberg germany in 1997morrisons influence on a younger generation of singersongwriters is pervasive the list of such singersongwriters influenced by morrison
