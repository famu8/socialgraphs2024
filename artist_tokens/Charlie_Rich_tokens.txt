belatedly became a white soul favorite in the early 1970sdespite his lack of consistent commercial success epic records signed rich in 1967 mainly on the recommendation of producer billy sherrill sherrill helped rich refashion himself as a nashville sound balladeer during an era when old rock n roll artists like jerry lee lewis and conway twitty were finding a new musical home in the country format this new countrypolitan rich sound paid off in the summer of 1972 when i take it on home went to number six on the country charts the title track from his 1973 album behind closed doors became a numberone country hit early in that year then crossed over into the top 20 on the pop charts this time his followup single did not disappoint as the most beautiful girl spent three weeks at the top of the country charts and two weeks at the top of the pop charts now that he was established as a country music star behind closed doors won three awards from the country music association that year

main company in 1970 also rereleased his previously recorded material from the mid1960s all of this success led the cma to name him entertainer of the year in 1974 in the same year he performed the academy awardnominated theme song i feel love benjis theme from the film benji rich had three more topfive hits in 1975 but though he was at the peak of his popularity he began to drink heavily causing considerable problems offstagerichs problematic drinking famously culminated at the cma awards ceremony for 1975 when he presented the award for entertainer of the year while visibly intoxicated after stumbling through the names of the nominees he clumsily tore open the envelope took out a cigarette lighter and lit fire to the paper with the winners name he then announced the winner of the award as my friend mr john denver some considered it an act of rebellion against the music rowcontrolled nashville sound others speculated that it was a protest against the award going to denver whose music rich had considered too pop and not enough country many including industry insiders were outraged and richs popularity took a divein a 2016 interview former cma executive director jo walkermeador speculated that richs drunkenness may have been in part due to resentment over his being shut out of the nominations that year after his success at the 1974 awards his son charlie jr says on his websiteill tell you why i thought he did it 1 he thought it would be funny he set it up by talking about how the potential winners were probably nervous as he had been the previous year 2 bad judgement he had recently broken his foot in a freak accident at his home in memphis sodue to the pain he took pain medication the night of the show bad idea secondly he and another country star got to drinking gin and tonics while waiting in the dressing room the show was long so by the time dad was supposed to go on the drinks on top of the medication got him buzzed primarily he thought it would be funny i know the last thing my father would have wanted to do was set himself up as judge of another musician he felt badly that people thought it was a statement against john denverthe slump in richs career was exacerbated by the fact that his records began to sound increasingly similar popinflected country ballads with overdubbed strings and little jazz or blues he did not have a top10 hit again until rollin with the flow went to number one on the country charts as well as number 32 on the easy listening charts in 1977 early the following year in 1978 he signed with united artists records and throughout that year he had hits on both epic and ua his hits in 1978 included the top10 hits beautiful woman puttin in overtime at home and his last number one with on my knees a duet with janie frickein 1979 rich had moderate success with his singles his biggest hit being a version of spanish eyes that entered the country top 20 he appeared as himself in the 1978 clint eastwood movie every which way but loose performing ill wake you up when i get home this song hit number three on the country charts in 1979 and was the last top10 country single of his career in 1980 he switched labels again to elektra records and that fall released a number12 country single a man just dont know what a woman goes through one more top40 hit followed the gary stewart song are we dreamin the same dream early in 1981 also in 1981 he had a bit part in the movie take this job and shove it which yielded his last charted single you made it beautiful rich decided
