fiddle player hugh farr joined the group adding a bass voice to the groups vocal arrangements he also sang lead on some songs later that year the pioneers trio became the sons of the pioneers through a radio station announcers chance remark asked why hed changed their name the announcer said they were too young to have been pioneers but that they could be sons of pioneers the name was received well and fit the group who were no longer a trioby the summer of 1934 the sons of the pioneers popularity and fame extended beyond the los angeles area and quickly spread across the united states through short syndicated radio segments that were rebroadcast all over the country they signed a recording contract with the newly founded decca label and on august 8 1934 the sons of the pioneers made their first commercial recording that same day the immensely popular crooner bing crosby also made his first decca sessionone of the first songs recorded by the sons of the pioneers during that first august session was written by bob nolan tumbling tumbleweeds that would soon become a staple in their repertoire the original title tumbling leaves was changed to give the song a western

pioneers rejoined rogers at republic and were soon appearing as highly popular supporting players in the rogers westernsby this time the group was billed as bob nolan and the sons of the pioneers nolan was reluctant to be the leader of the group which had been formed as a cooperative outfit with no formal leader but he bowed to the demands of show business agents music publishers and recording companies insisted that cooperative bands needed a name to promote them as in glen gray and the casa loma orchestra because bob nolans featured appearances with starrett had made him the most recognizable of the pioneers nolan reluctantly became the front for the group the group as bob nolan and the sons of the pioneers made guest appearances in the warner bros allstar revue hollywood

farr and ken carson the earliest shows include studio musician ivan ditmars accompanying them on piano and organ nolan appreciated ditmarss efforts but preferred that the groups established sound
