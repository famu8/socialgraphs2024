evangeline a tale of acadie is an epic poem by the american poet henry wadsworth longfellow written in english and published in 1847 the poem follows an acadian girl named evangeline and her search for her lost love gabriel during the expulsion of the acadians 1755–1764the idea for the poem came from longfellows friend nathaniel hawthorne longfellow used dactylic hexameter imitating greek and latin classics though the choice was criticized it became longfellows most famous work in his lifetime and remains one of his most popular and enduring worksthe poem had a powerful effect in defining both acadian history and identity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries it represents lost loved ones and heartbreak but also keeping hope while longfellow was a poet not a historian twentyfirst century scholarship has included those who chose to expound their view that longfellows work fails as a scientific historical documentevangeline describes the betrothal of a fictional acadian girl named evangeline bellefontaine to her beloved gabriel lajeunesse and their separation as the british deport the acadians from acadie in the great upheavallongfellow was introduced to the true story of the acadians in nova scotia by his friend nathaniel hawthorne who was told a story of separated acadian lovers by boston minister rev horace conolly who heard it from his parishioners hawthorne and longfellow had attended bowdoin college together though they were not friends at the time years later in 1837 hawthorne contacted longfellow for his opinion on his recently published tales in the north american review which longfellow praised as works of genius the two became lifelong friends hawthorne was not interested in fictionalizing conollys idea because as he told conolly it is not in my vein there are no strong lights and heavy shadows longfellow took the idea and turned it into a poem after months of studying the histories of nova scotian familieslongfellow who had never visited the setting of the true story relied heavily on thomas chandler haliburtons an historical and statistical account of nova scotia and other books for further background information he noted his reliance on other sources in his journal on january 7 1847 went to the library and got watsons annals of philadelphia and the historical collections of pennsylvania also darbys geographical description of louisiana these books must help me through the last part of evangeline so far as facts and local coloring go but for the form and the poetry—they must come from my own brainevangeline was published in book form on november 1 1847 by william d ticknor co and by 1857 it had sold nearly 36000 copies during this time longfellows literary payment was at its peak for evangeline he received a net of twentyfive and sixteenths per cent royalties believed to be an alltime high for a poet longfellow said of his poem i had the fever a long time burning in my own brain before i let my hero take it evangeline is so easy for you to read because it was so hard for me to writethe poem is written in unrhymed dactylic hexameter possibly inspired by greek and latin classics including homer whose work longfellow was reading at the time he was writing evangeline he also had recently in 1841 translated the children of the lords supper a poem by swedish writer esaias tegnér which also used this meter evangeline is one of the few nineteenthcentury compositions in that meter which is still read todaysome criticized longfellows choice of dactylic hexameter including poet john greenleaf whittier who said the poem would have been better in a prose style similar to longfellows hyperion longfellow was conscious of the potential criticism when sending a copy of the poem to bryan procter longfellow wrote i hope you will not reject it on account of the meter in fact i could not write it as it is in any other it would have changed its character entirely to have put it into a different measure even longfellows wife fanny defended his choice writing to a friend it enables greater richness of expression than any other and it is sonorous like the sea which is ever sounding in evangelines ear as an experiment longfellow reassured himself that he was using the best meter by attempting a passage in blank verse even so while looking over the proofs for a second edition longfellow briefly wished he had used a different poetic structureit certainly would be a relief to the hexameters to let them stretch their legs a little more at their ease still for the sake of uniformity i believe they must still sit a while longer with their knees bent under them like travelers in a stagecoachthe name evangeline comes from the latin word evangelium meaning gospel the latin word itself is derived from the greek words eu—good—and angela—newslongfellow does not explicitly title the opening three stanzas as the prologue but publishers generally treat these lines as such the poems story begins with the end the french farmers and fishermen who once inhabited the colony of acadie in nova scotia are gone the mosscovered trees and the ocean are left to tell the talethis is the forest primeval the murmuring pines and the hemlocks bearded with moss and in garments green indistinct in the twilight stand like druids of eld with voices sad and prophetic stand like harpers hoar with beards that rest on their bosoms loud from its rocky caverns the deepvoiced neighboring ocean speaks and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest this is the forest primeval but where are the hearts that beneath it leaped like the roe when he hears in the woodland the voice of the huntsman where is the thatchroofed village the home of acadian farmers— men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands darkened by shadows of earth but reflecting an image of heaven waste are those pleasant farms and the farmers forever departed scattered like dust and leaves when the mighty blasts of october seize them and whirl them aloft and sprinkle them far oer the ocean naught but tradition remains of the beautiful village of grandpré ye who believe in affection that hopes and endures and is patient ye who believe in the beauty and strength of womans devotion list to the mournful tradition still sung by the pines of the forest list to a tale of love in acadie home of the happyevangeline became longfellows most famous work in his lifetime and was widely read it has been called the first important long poem in american literature contemporary reviews were very positive a reviewer for the metropolitan magazine said no one with any pretensions to poetic feeling can read its delicious portraiture of rustic scenery and of a mode of life long since defunct without the most intense delight longfellows friend charles sumner said he had met a woman who has read evangeline some twenty times and thinks it the most perfect poem in the language other admirers of the poem included king leopold i of belgium speaking privately all of longfellows literary associates but whittier attacked the piece including his old friend john neal who wrote you really ought to be hanged–drawn and quartered for writing in hexameterprior to the influence of longfellows poem historians generally focused on the founding of halifax 1749 as the beginning of nova scotian history longfellows poem shed light on the 150 years of acadian settlement that preceded the establishment of halifaxthe expulsion was planned and executed by the british and new england authorities longfellow omitted from the poem new englands involvement in the expulsion through his poem longfellow defines america as a place of refuge for the exiled acadians longfellows account was later challenged by historian francis parkman in his book montcalm and wolfe 1884 parkman claimed the real reason for the expulsion was the influence held by the french over the acadians particularly by abbé jeanlouis le loutre american historian john brebner eventually wrote new englands outpost 1927 which identified how instrumental new englanders were in the expulsion of the acadiansthe poem had a powerful impact in defining both acadian history and identity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries more recent scholarship has revealed both the historical misconceptions in the poem and the complexity of the expulsion and those involved which the poem obscures for example longfellows poem depicts acadia as a utopia and the acadians as a homogeneous and passive people who are incapable of violence which ignores the efforts of resistance leader joseph broussard and the extensive military history of the acadians the poem also allowed for generations of protestant angloamericans to sympathize with the plight of the acadians while maintaining anticatholic viewpoints the poem also provided a safe symbolic space for acadians to develop arguments for more recognition and respect in the united statesin 1920 at grandpré nova scotia acadians reconstructed the french church with a statue of evangeline in the courtyard almost a decade later in 1929 a statue of evangeline posed for by silent mexican film star dolores del río who starred in the 1929 film evangeline was donated to the town of st martinville louisiana by the films cast and crew in 1934 the
