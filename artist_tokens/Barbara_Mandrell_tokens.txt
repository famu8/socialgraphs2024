jason ankeny of allmusic found that the most popular era of her career late 1970s and early 1980s had a glitzier more popinfluenced sound kurt wolff highlighted a similar theme in his book country music the rough guide collins churned out frightfully slick and garnish productions but mandrell thrived in her new environment hunter kelly of rolling stone explained that when mandrell began incorporating rb sounds into her style that her career really kicked into overdrive mandrell further explained her reasoning behind incorporating rb to me country music and rb music have a lot of similarities but the one thing that i think is the most important is both genres just straight ahead theyre telling you theyre not making up a story just because it rhymes nicelywriters found that mandrell had her greatest commercial success with songs that incorporated subjects of cheating mary a bufwack and robert k oermann found this to be especially evident after she transitioned to her second record label barbara continued to smolder in sin after moving to the abcmca records fold in 1975 kurt wolff found a similar theme with cheating material the subjects of many of mandrells songs were also racy for the time dealing openly with such topics as lust sexual loneliness and late nightnight love trysts wolff further commented whats ironic about her subject matter is that mandrell herself–a devout christian mother and wife– always maintained an impeccably clean family–oriented profile ive recorded a lot of cheating songs but there were a lot of cheating songs i turned down it depends on the lyricsgod loves prostitutes too mandrell further commentedmandrells singing voice has also been the subject of discussion amongst writers and critics mary bufwack and robert oermann commented that her habit of smoking cigarettes made her voice stand out barbara is a heavy smoker and this gives her vocals a hoarse urgent quality that she put to good use on blueeyed soul versions of rb songs they commented in 2003 in 1982 the washington post highlighted mandrells singing in a review of her concert performance at other times the gritty edges of her husky voice crackled with rb flourishes and gospel fervor it was an impressive display in 1984 the oklahoman commented on her live singing as well she can perform almost anything short of grand opera in fact if she took a mind to she probably could do that too after all linda ronstadt didmandrell has been widely considered among country musics most successful artists and all–around entertainers perhaps the toughest soldier in the female army that invaded the country charts in the 1970s barbara could outwork outperform outtalk and outsmile virtually anyone in show business wrote mary a bufwack and robert k oermann jason
