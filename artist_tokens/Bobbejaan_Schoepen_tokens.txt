barrandov studios in prague in kempen and in bobbejaanland which at the time was still without attractionsduring the sixties and seventies he was a regular visitor to the united states where he took up with actor roy rogers nudie cohn the fashion designer of elvis johnny cash and others and tex williams the founding father of western swing the foursome occasionally performed together in local clubsin 1958 schoepen purchased a big circus tent to be able to tour more efficiently in his own country doing so freed him from having to deal with music venue owners who were asking for everincreasing rental prices and did not always have appropriate space for his program he took over the twomaster circus tent from the tondeur family who were finding it difficult to keep their performances profitable schoepen was handed the organizational reins and the circus again began to flourish the day before a show he would promote the show himself at the designated location sometimes in his own bizarre manneran american circus stunt team came to brussels on the occasion of the world exhibition expo 58 it was a private endeavor led by casey tibbs but because of the excessively long distance to the actual expo events and the persistent bad weather they went bankrupt they could no longer afford to care for their fifty horses and so the team had to return to the us tibbs had no choice but to give away some of the equipment and among other things he sold zorros horse—named midnight from the zorro television series—to bobbejaan schoepen he used the horse for many years for stunts in his shows and as an attraction during his cavalcades but the horse stepped on an exposed electricity cable and diedin 1959 schoepen bought a new circus tent it had room for 900 people and could be expanded to accommodate a capacity of 1200 these tours came to an end as soon as bobbejaanland opened its doors in 1961 using a circus tent for concert tours was unique for its timebetween 1950 and 1967 he acted in five musical film productions two belgian two german and one germanczech in 1962 he played the leading role in the absurd comedy at the drop of a head alias de ordannans together with leaders of the flemish film scene ann peterson yvonne lex denise deweerdt nand buyl and tony bell the dutch and english versions were recorded on the set at the same time schoepen was not pleased with this particular adventure into the world of film the takes were chaotic and they fired two different directors jef bruyninckx alias de witte had to solve everything in 1999 the belgian cultrock band dead man ray toured through belgium and the netherlands with the film for daan stuyven daan and rudy trouvé exdeus it is also an ode to the sometimes misunderstoodartistic versatility that characterized schoepen the artistit was never schoepens intention to build an amusement park the current park arose from his musical career after nearly 15 years of constant touring he began thinking about a place to settle down in 1959 he bought a 30 hectare marshy domain in lichtaartkasterlee called the abroek there he built a theater with nearly 1000 seats and created a 22 kilometer beach this was to become bobbejaanland a name coined by his manager jacques kluger on 31 december 1961 bobbejaanland was officially opened by bobbejaan schoepen and his wife josée with whom he developed the park into his lifes work during the high season schoepen himself performed from two to five concerts per day artists from the belgian dutch and german cabaretworld performed there as well though not during schoepens own programbobbejaanland evolved from 1975 onwards into a fully fledged amusement park schoepen focused his attention solely on the business aspect of the park slowly pushing his musical career into the background his performances became a rarity but bobbejaanland which he operated with his family developed into one of the top amusement parks in the benelux regionin the mid80s the shows became more streamlined and oriented toward a more international audience the amusement park finally dominated the cabaret and the entrepreneur the artist he did continue singing albeit with more streamlined shows which inevitably gave way to the routine of the amusement parkbobbejaan schoepens life was not without its difficulties he was thrown into prison twice during wartime he lost his virtuoso whistling ability due to a surgical intervention and in 1986 he underwent a serious heart operation in 1999 he was diagnosed with intestinal cancer which raised the issue of selling bobbejaanland his lifes work but he continued and in the winter of 2003 a major investment of nearly 12 million euros was made on two unique rides typhoon and sledge hammer that year the flemish consumer magazine testaankoop conducted a comparative survey of 13 european amusement parks bobbejaanland was the most highly esteemed park in belgium on almost every level and in europe it shared second place together with disneyland and the parc astérixhowever in april 2004 after preparing for more than three years the family finally decided to sell the park at that time bobbejaanland employed 400 people and was taken over by parques reunidos a spanishamerican amusement park group it remained uncertain until the very last minute whether the founder would put his signature on the deal uncertainty over the future of amusement parks was ultimately decisive the schoepen family chose the more certain path which also seemed evident to the founder after the sale when the news program terzake on the flemish broadcast vrt asked him if he had chosen to take the big money schoepen answered staring ahead blankly what am i going to do with all that money i can only eat twice a dayschoepen was considered to be the artistic attraction of the park his wife josée the oldest of eighteen children was a leading figure and the commercial backbone and her sister louise wies was the solid foundation with respect to accounting and financeswith the sale of the park the last family business in the amusement park sector in belgium disappeared schoepen and his wife lived on the domain together until his death in may 2010schoepen recovered from his illness and was again engaged in music in 2005 he gave four surprise performances at the literary festival saintamour
