beating in a cmt episode of inside fame dedicated to joness life country music historian robert k oermann said you would think that it would make him not a singer because it was so abusively thrust on

autobiography the jones family makeup doesnt sit well with liquor daddy was an unusual drinker he drank to excess but never while working and he probably was the hardest working man ive ever known his

for attempting to sound too much like his heroes hank williams and lefty frizzell in 1996 jones recalled to npr that the quality of production at starday was poor it was a terrible sound we recorded in a small living room of a house on a highway near beaumont you could hear the trucks we had to stop a lot of times because it wasnt soundproof it was just egg crates nailed on the wall and the big old semi trucks would go by and make a lot of noise and wed have to start over again joness first hit came with why baby why in 1955 and in that year while touring as a cast member of the louisiana hayride jones met and played shows with elvis presley and johnny cash in 1994 jones told nick tosches that presley stayed pretty much with his friends around him in his dressing room jones remained a lifelong friend of johnny cash and was invited to sing at the grand ole opry in 1956with presleys explosion in popularity in 1956 pressure was put on jones to cut some rockabilly sides he reluctantly agreed but his heart was not in it and he quickly regretted his decision he joked later in his autobiography when ive encountered those records ive used them for frisbees he told billboard in 2006 i was desperate when youre hungry a poor man with a house full of kids youre gon na do some things you ordinarily wouldnt do i said well hell ill try anything once i tried dadgum it how come it and rock

partners he would have over the years and had another top10 single with yearning starday records merged with mercury that year and jones was rated highly on the charts with his debut mercury release dont stop the music although he was garnering a lot of attention and his singles were making very respectable showings on the charts he was still travelling the blacktop roads in a 1940s packard with his name and phone number on the side playing the blood bucket circuit of honkytonks that dotted the rural countrysidein 1959 jones had his first number one on the billboard country chart with white lightnin which was a more authentic rock and roll sound than his halfhearted rockabilly cutsjones had early success as a songwriter he wrote or cowrote many of his biggest hits during this period several of which became standards such as window up above later a hit for mickey gilley in 1975 and seasons of my heart a hit for johnny cash and also recorded by willie nelson and jerry lee lewis jones wrote just one more also recorded by cash life to go a topfive hit for stonewall jackson in 1959 you got ta be my baby and dont stop the music on his own and had a hand in writing color of the blues covered by loretta lynn and elvis costello tender years and tall tall trees cowritten with roger miller joness most frequent songwriting collaborator was his childhood friend darrell edwardsjones signed with united artists in 1962 and immediately scored one of the biggest hits of his career she thinks i still care his voice had grown deeper during this period and he began cultivating his own singing style during his stint with ua jones recorded albums of hank williams and bob wills songs and cut an album of duets with melba montgomery including the hit we must have been out of our minds jones was also gaining a reputation as a hellraiser in his rolling stone tribute merle haggard recalledjones was always backed by the jones boys on tour like buck owenss buckaroos and merle haggards strangers jones worked with many talented musicians including dan schafer hank singer brittany allyn sonny curtis kent goodson bobby birkhead and steve hinson in the 1980s and 1990s bass player ron gaddis served as the jones boys bandleader and sang harmony with jones in concert lorrie morgan who married gaddis also toured as a backup singer for jones in the late 1970s and early 1980s johnny paycheck was the jones boys bass player in the 1960s before going on to his own stardom in the 1970sin 1964 pappy daily secured a new contract with musicor records for the rest of the 1960s jones scored only one number one 1967s walk through this world with me but he featured often in the country music charts significant hits included love bug a nod to buck owens and the bakersfield sound things have gone to pieces the race is on my favorite lies ill share my world with you take me which he cowrote and later recorded with tammy wynette a good year for the roses and if my heart had windows joness singing style had by now evolved from the fullthroated high lonesome sound of hank williams and roy acuff on his early starday records to the more refined subtle style of lefty frizzell in a 2006 interview with billboard jones acknowledged the fellow texans influence on his idiosyncratic phrasing i got that from lefty he always made five syllables out of one wordjoness binge drinking and use of amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 and he had to be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him a drinking story concerning jones occurred while he was married to his second wife shirley corley jones recalled shirley trying to prevent him from travelling to beaumont 8 miles away to buy liquor she said she hid the keys to all their cars but she did not hide the keys to the lawn mower he wrote in his memoir there gleaming in the glow was that tenhorsepower rotary engine under a seat a key glistening in the ignition i imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour it might have taken an hour and a half or more for me to get to the liquor store but get there i did years later jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for all my rowdy friends are coming over tonight by hank williams jr he also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for one more last chance by vince gill and in his own music video for the single honky tonk song in 1996 tammy wynette in her 1979 autobiography stand by your man claimed the incident occurred while she was married to jones she said she woke at one in the morning to find her husband gone i got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away when i pulled into the parking lot there sat our ridermower right by the entrance hed driven that mower right down a main highway he looked up and saw me and said ‘ well fellas here she is now my little wife i told you shed come after me ’ jones had become aware of tammy wynette because their tours were booked by the same agency and their paths sometimes crossed wynette was married to songwriter don chapel who was also the opening act for her shows and the three became friends jones married wynette in 1969they began touring together and jones bought out his contract with musicor so that he could record with wynette and her producer billy sherrill on epic records after she had split with longtime producer pappy daily in the early 1970s jones and wynette became known as mr mrs country music and scored several big hits including were gon na hold on lets build a world together golden ring and near you when asked about recording jones and wynette sherill told dan daley in 2002 we started out trying to record the vocals together but george drove tammy crazy with his phrasing he never ever did it the same way twice he could make a fivesyllable word out of church finally tammy said record george and let me listen to it and then do my vocal after we get his on tape in october 1970 shortly after the birth of their only child tamala georgette jones was straitjacketed and committed to a padded cell at the watson clinic in lakeland florida after a drunken bender he was kept there for 10 days to detoxify before being released with a prescription for librium jones managed to stay sober with wynette for long periods but as the decade wore on his drinking and erratic behavior worsened and they divorced in 1976 jones accepted responsibility for the failure of the marriage but denied wynettes allegations in her autobiography that he had beaten her and fired a shotgun at her jones and wynette continued playing shows and drawing crowds after their divorce as fans began to see their songs mirroring their stormy relationship in 1980 they recorded the album together again and scored a hit with two story house in the 2019 ken burns documentary country music jones and wynette were compared to two wounded animals jones also spoke of his hopes for a reconciliation and would jokingly reference wynette in some of his songs – during performances of his 1981 hit if drinkin dont kill me her memory will he would sing tammys memory will – but the recriminations continued jones and wynette appeared to make peace in the 1990s and recorded a final album one and toured together again before wynettes death in 1998 in 1995 jones told country weekly like the old saying goes it takes time to heal things and theyve been healed quite a whilejoness pairing with billy sherrill at epic records came as a surprise to many sherrill and business partner glenn sutton are regarded as the defining influences of the countrypolitan sound a smooth amalgamation of pop and country music that was popular during the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s a far cry from georges honkytonk roots despite a shaky start the success that sherrill had with jones proved to be his most enduring although billboard chart statistics show that sherrill had his biggest commercial successes with artists such as wynette and charlie rich with jones sherrill had his longestlasting association in sherrill jones found what andrew meuller of uncut described as the producer capable of creating the epically lachrymose arrangements his voice deserved and his torment demandedhe summoned for jones the symphonies of sighing strings that almost made the misery of albums like 1974s the grand tour and 1976s alone again sound better than happiness could possibly feel in 1974 they scored a numberone hit with the instant classic the grand tour and followed that with the door ive heard the sound of my dear old mother cryinand the sound of the train that took me off to war another numberone smash unlike most singers who might have been overwhelmed by the string arrangements and background vocalists sherrill sometimes employed on his records joness voice with its at times frightening intensity and lucid tone could stand up to anything while jones wrote fewer songs himself – songwriters had been tripping over themselves pitching songs to him for years – he still managed to cowrite several such as what my woman cant do also recorded by jerry lee lewis a drunk cant be a man the harrowing i just dont give a damn perhaps the greatest lost classic in the entire jones catalogue and these days i barely get by which he had written with wynettein the late 1970s jones spiraled out of control already drinking constantly a manager named shug baggot introduced him to cocaine before a show because he was too tired to perform the drug increased joness already considerable paranoia during one drunken binge he shot at and very nearly hit his friend and occasional songwriting partner earl peanutt montgomery after montgomery had quit drinking after finding religion he was often penniless and acknowledged in his autobiography that waylon jennings and johnny cash came to his financial aid during this time jones also began missing shows at an alarming rate and lawsuits from promoters started piling up in 1978 owing wynette 36000 in child support and claiming to be 1 million in debt he filed for bankruptcy jones appeared incoherent at times speaking in quarrelling voices that he would later call the duck and the old man in his article the devil in george jones nick tosches states by february 1979 he was homeless deranged and destitute living in his car and barely able to digest the junk food on which he subsisted he weighed under a hundred pounds and his condition was so bad that it took him more than two years to complete my very special guests an album on which willie nelson linda ronstadt elvis costello and other famous fans came to his vocal aid and support jones entered hillcrest psychiatric hospital in birmingham alabama upon his release in january 1980 the first thing he did was pick up a sixpackjones often displayed a sheepish selfdeprecating sense of humor regarding his dire financial standing and bad reputation in june 1979 he appeared with waylon jennings on ralph emerys syndicated radio program and at one point jennings cracked its lonely at the top a laughing jones replied its lonely at the bottom too its real real lonely waylon despite his chronic unreliability jones was still capable of putting on a captivating live show on independence day 1976 he appeared at willie nelsons fourth of july picnic in gonzales texas in front of 80000 younger countryrock oriented fans a nervous jones felt out of his comfort zone and nearly bolted from the festival but went on anyway and wound up stealing the show the houston post wrote he was the undisputed star of this years willie nelson picnicone of the greatest penthouse called him the spirit of country music plain and simple its holy ghost the village voice added as a singer he is as intelligent as they come and should be considered for a spot in americas alltime top ten jones began missing more shows than he made however including several highly publicized dates at the bottom line club in new york city former vice president of cbs records rick blackburn recalls in the 1989 video same ole me that the event had been hyped for weeks with a lot of top press and cast members from saturday night live planning to attend wed made our plans travel arrangements and so forth george excused himself from my office left – and we didnt see him for three weeks he just did not show up much like hank williams jones seemed suspicious of success and furiously despised perceived slights and condescension directed towards the music that he loved so dearly when he finally played the bottom line in 1980 the new york times called him the finest most riveting singer in country musicby 1980 george jones had not achieved a numberone single in six years leading many critics to doubt his career however he surprised the music industry when he stopped loving her today reached number one on the country charts staying there for 18 weeks the song written by bobby braddock and curly putman tells the story of a man who continues to love his departed lover until his death joness poignant delivery of the song has made it one of the greatest country songs of all time joness interpretation buoyed by his delivery of the line first time id seen him smile in years gives it a mournful gripping realism it is consistently voted as one of the greatest country songs of all time along with im so lonesome i could cry by hank williams and crazy by patsy cline jones who personally hated the song and considered it morbid ultimately gave the song credit for reviving his flagging career stating a fourdecade career had been salvaged by a threeminute song jones earned the grammy award for best male country vocal performance in 1980 the academy of country music awarded the song single of the year and song of the year in 1980 it also became the country music associations song of the year in both 1980 and 1981the success of he stopped loving her today led cbs records to renew joness recording contract and sparked new interest in the singer he was the subject of an hourandaquarterlong hbo television special entitled george jones with a little help from his friends which had him performing songs with waylon jennings elvis costello tanya tucker and tammy wynette among others jones continued drinking and using cocaine appearing at various awards shows to accept honors for he stopped loving her today obviously inebriated like when he performed i was country when country wasnt cool with barbara mandrell at the 1981 country music association awards he was involved in several highspeed car chases with police which were reported on the national news and one arrest was filmed by a local tv crew the video which is widely available online offers a glimpse into joness alter ego when drinking as he argues with the police officer and lunges at the camera man conversely when sober jones was known to be friendly and down to earth even shy in a 1994 article on jones nick tosches remarked that when he first interviewed the singer in april 1976 one could readily believe the accounts by those who had known him for years that he had not changed much at all and that he had been impervious to fame and fortune in an unusually unguarded selfappraisal in 1981 the singer told mark rose of the village voice i dont show a lot of affection i have probably been a very unliked person among family like somebody who was heartless i saved it all for the songs i didnt know you were supposed to show that love person to person i guess i always wanted to but i didnt know how the only way i could would be to do it in a song years later he commented to the christian broadcasting networks scott ross about himself i think youre mad at yourself i think that youre sayin to yourself you dont deserve this you dont deserve those fans you dont deserve makin this money and youre mad at yourself and you beat up on yourself by drinkin and losing friends that wont put up with thatits just one terrible big mess you make out of your life in 1982 jones recorded the album a taste of yesterdays wine with merle haggard while jones in the wake of his condition appeared underweight on the album cover his singing was flawless his run of hits also continued in the early 1980s with the singer charting im not ready yet same ole me backed by the oak ridge boys still doin time tennessee whiskey we didnt see a thing a duet with ray charles and i always get lucky with you which was joness last number one in 1984in 1981 jones met nancy sepulvado a 34yearold divorcée from mansfield louisiana sepulvados positive impact on joness life and career can not be overstated she eventually cleaned up his finances kept him away from his drug dealers who reportedly kidnapped her daughter in retaliation and managed his career jones always gave her complete credit for saving his life nancy who did not drink explained to nick tosches in 1994 he was drinking but he was fun to be around it wasnt love at first sight or anything like that but i saw what a good person he was deep down and i couldnt help caring about him jones managed to quit cocaine but went on a drunken rampage in alabama in fall 1983 and was once again straitjacketed and committed to hillcrest psychiatric hospital suffering from malnutrition and delusions by that time though physically and emotionally exhausted he really did want to quit drinking in march 1984 in birmingham alabama – at the age of 52 – jones performed his first sober show since the early 70s all my life it seems like ive been running from something he told the united press international in june if i knew what it was maybe i could run in the right direction but i always seem to end up going the other way jones began making up many of the dates he had missed playing them for free to pay back promoters and began opening his concerts with no show jones a song he had written with glen martin that poked fun at himself and other country singers jones always stressed that he was not proud of the way he treated loved ones and friends over the years and was ashamed of disappointing his fans when he missed shows telling billboard in 2006 i know it hurt my fans in a way and ive always been sad about that it really bothered me for a long timemostly sober for the rest of the 1980s jones consistently released albums with sherrill producing including shine on jones country youve still got a place in my heart whos gon na fill their shoes wine colored roses an album jones would tell jolene downs in 2001 was one of his personal favorites too wild too long and one woman man joness video for his 1985 hit whos gon na fill their shoes won the cma award for video of the year billy sherrill makes a cameo as the bus driverin 1990 jones released his last proper studio album on epic you oughta be here with me although the album featured several stirring performances including the lead single hell stays open all night long and the roger millerpenned title song the single did poorly and jones made the switch to mca ending his relationship with sherrill and what was now sony music after 19 years his first album with mca and along came jones was released in 1991 and backed by mcas powerful promotion team and producer kyle lehning who had produced a string of hit albums for randy travis the album sold better than his previous one had however two singles you couldnt get the picture and she loved a lot in her time a tribute to joness mother clara did not crack the top 30 on the charts as jones lost favor with country radio as the format was altered radically during the early 1990s his last album to have significant radio airplay was 1992s walls can fall which featured the novelty song finally friday and i dont need your rockin chair a testament to his continued vivaciousness in his sixties despite the lack of radio airplay jones continued to record and tour throughout the 1990s and was inducted into the country music hall of fame by randy travis in 1992 in 1996 jones released his autobiography i lived to tell it all with tom carter and the irony of his long career was not lost on him with the singer writing in its preface i also know that a lot of my showbusiness peers are going to be angry after reading this book so many have worked so hard to maintain their careers i never took my career seriously and yet its flourishing he also pulled no punches about his disappointment in the direction country music had taken devoting a full chapter to the changes in the country music scene of the 1990s that had him removed from radio playlists in favor of a younger generation of popinfluenced country stars jones had long been a critic of country pop and along with wynette and jean shepard he was one of the major backers of the association of country entertainers a guild promoting traditional country sounds that was founded in 1974 joness divorce from wynette was a factor in the associations collapse despite his absence from the country charts during this time latterday country superstars such as garth brooks randy travis alan jackson and many others often paid tribute to jones while expressing their love and respect for his legacy as a true country legend who paved the way for their own success on february 17 1998 the nashville network premiered a group of television specials called the george jones show with jones as host the program featured informal chats with jones holding court with countrys biggest stars old and new and of course music guests included loretta lynn trace adkins johnny paycheck lorrie morgan merle haggard billy ray cyrus tim mcgraw faith hill charley pride bobby bare patty loveless and waylon jennings among otherswhile jones remained committed to pure country he worked with the top producers and musicians of the day and the quality of his work remained high some of his significant performances include i must have done something bad wild irish rose billy b bad a sarcastic jab at country music establishment trendsetters a thousand times a day when the last curtain falls and the novelty hightech redneck joness most popular song in his later years was choices the first single from his 1999 studio album cold hard truth a video was also made for the song and jones won another grammy for best male country vocal performance the song was at the center of controversy when the country music association invited jones to perform it on the awards show but required that he perform an abridged version jones refused and did not attend the show alan jackson was disappointed with the associations decision and halfway through his own performance during the show he signaled to his band and played part of joness song in proteston march 6 1999 jones was involved in an accident when he crashed his sport utility vehicle near his home he was taken to the vanderbilt university medical center vumc where he was released two weeks later in may of that year jones pleaded guilty to drunkdriving charges related to the accident in his memoir published three years earlier jones admitted that he sometimes had a glass of wine before dinner and that he still drank beer occasionally but insisted i dont squirm in my seat fighting the urge for another drink and speculated perhaps im not a true alcoholic in the modern sense of the word perhaps i was always just an old fashioned drunk the crash was a significant turning point as he explained to billboard in 2006 when i had that wreck i made up my mind it put the fear of god in me no more smoking no more drinking i didnt have to have no help i made up my mind to quit i dont crave it after the accident jones went on to release the gospel collection in 2003 for which billy sherrill came out of retirement to produce he appeared at a televised

god for it because it makes me a living but i sing because i love it not because of the dollar signs jones also went out of his way to promote younger country singers that he felt were as passionate about the music as he was everybody knows hes a great singer alan jackson stated in 1995 but what i like most about george is that when you meet him he is like some old guy that works down at the gas stationeven though hes a legendshortly after joness death andrew mueller wrote about his influence in uncut he was one of the finest interpretive singers who ever lifted a microphonethere can not be a single country songwriter of the last 50odd years who has not wondered what it might be like to hear their words sung by that voice in an article for the texas monthly in 1994 nick tosches eloquently described the singers vocal style while he and his idol hank williams have both affected generations with a plaintive veracity of voice that has set them apart jones has an additional gift—a voice of exceptional range natural elegance and lucent tone gliding toward high tenor plunging toward deep bass the magisterial portamento of his onwardcoursing baritone emits whitehot sparks and torrents of blue investing his poison love songs with a tragic gravity and inflaming his celebrations of the honkytonk ethos with the hellfire of abandon in an essay printed in the new republic david hajdu writesdavid cantwell recalled in 2013 his approach to singing he told me once was to call up those memories and feelings of his own that most closely corresponded to those being felt by the character in whatever song he was performing he was a kind of singing method actor creating an illusion of the real in the liner notes to essential george jones the spirit of country rich kienzle states jones sings of people and stories that are achingly human he can turn a ballad into a catharsis by wringing every possible emotion from it making it a primal strangled cry of anguish in 1994 country music historian colin escott pronounced contemporary country music is virtually founded on reverence for george jones walk through a room of country singers and conduct a quick poll george nearly always tops it waylon jennings expressed a similar opinion in his song its alright if we all could sound like we wanted to wed all sound like george jones in the wake of joness death merle haggard pronounced in rolling stone his voice was like a stradivarius violin one of the greatest instruments ever made emmylou harris wrote when you hear george jones sing you are hearing a man who takes a song and makes it a work of art—always a quote that appeared on the sleeve of joness 1976 album the battleseveral country music stars praised jones in the documentary same ole me randy travis said it sounds like hes lived every minute of every word that he sings and theres very few people who can do that tom t hall said it was always jones who got the message across just right roy acuff said id give anything if i could sing like george jones in the same film producer billy sherrill states all i did was change the instrumentation around him i dont think hes changed at allin 2023 rolling stone
