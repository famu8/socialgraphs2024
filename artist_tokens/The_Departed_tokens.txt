brad pitt bought the rights to remake the hong kong film infernal affairs 2002 from media asia for 175 million william monahan was secured as a screenwriter and later martin scorsese who admired monahans script came on board as directorin march 2004 united press international announced that scorsese would be remaking infernal affairs and setting it in boston and that leonardo dicaprio and brad pitt were slated to star pitt tentatively scheduled to play sullivan later declined to play the role saying a younger actor should play the part he decided to produce the film instead scorseses associate kenneth lonergan suggested matt damon who grew up in boston for the part of sullivan and scorsese asked jack nicholson to play costello robert de niro was approached to play queenan but de niro declined in order to direct the good shepherd instead scorsese would later say that de niro turned down the role as he was not interested ray liotta was approached for a role in the film but declined due to a commitment to another projectnicholson wanted the film to have something a little more than the usual gangster film and screenwriter monahan came up with the idea of basing the costello character on irishamerican gangster whitey bulger this gave the screenplay an element of realism—and an element of dangerous uncertainty because of the wideranging carte blanche the fbi gave bulger in exchange for revealing information about fellow gangsters a technical consultant on the film was tom duffy who had served three decades on the boston police department particularly as an undercover detective investigating the irish mobthe departed was officially greenlit by warner bros in early 2005 and began shooting in the spring of that year some of the film was shot on location in boston for budgetary and logistical reasons many scenes in particular interiors were shot in locations and sets in new york city which had tax incentives for filmmakers that boston at the time did notfilm critic stanley kauffmann said that for the departed scorsese was apparently concerned with the idea of identity one of the ancient themes of drama and how it affects ones actions emotions selfknowledge even dreams kauffmann however did not find the theme conveyed with particular effectiveness in the film film critic roger ebert compared costigan and sullivans seeking of approval from those they are deceiving to stockholm syndrome ebert also noted the themes of catholic guiltin the final scene a rat is seen on sullivans window ledge scorsese acknowledges that while it is not meant to be taken literally it somewhat symbolizes the quest for the rat in the film and the strong sense of distrust among the characters much like post911 us the window view behind the rat is a nod to gangster films like little caesar 1931 scarface 1932 and white heat 1949 the films penultimate scene at costigans funeral when madden walks straight past sullivan and out of camera without looking at him is a visual quotation of the famous closing scene from the third manthroughout the film scorsese uses an x motif to foreshadow death in a manner similar to howard hawks film scarface 1932 examples include shots of crossbeam supports in an airport walkway when costigan is phoning sgt dignam the lighted x on the wall in sullivans office when he assures costello over the phone that costigan is not the rat the taped windows of the building queenan enters before being thrown to his death behind costigans head in the elevator before he is shot and the carpeted hallway floor when sullivan returns to his apartment before being shot by dignam at the films endthe departed grossed 1324 million in the united states and canada and 159 million in other territories for a total gross of 2915 million

past successes including taxi driver raging bull and goodfellasandrew lau codirector of infernal affairs in an interview with hong kong newspaper apple daily said of course i think the version i made is better but the hollywood version is pretty good too made the hollywood version more attuned to american culture andy lau one of the main actors in infernal affairs when asked how the movie compares to the original said the departed was too long and it felt as if hollywood had combined all three infernal affairs movies together although lau said the script of the remake had some golden quotes he also felt it had a bit too much profanity he ultimately rated the departed eight out of ten and said that the hollywood remake is worth a view though according to laus spokeswoman alice tam he felt that the combination of the two female characters into one in the departed was not as good as the original storylinea few critics were disappointed in the film including j hoberman of the village
