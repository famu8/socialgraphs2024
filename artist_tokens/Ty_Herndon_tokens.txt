industry association of america riaa for shipments of 500000 copies executives of sony music nashville of which epic was a division at the time attributed the albums commercial success to a marketing

virden and drew womack then recording on epic in sons of the desert thom owens of allmusic wrote although he is in fine voice throughout the album ty herndons living in a moment is bogged down by mediocre material that fails to given him a proper showcase for his talents he considered the title track and dont tell mama the strongest lyrically alanna nash of entertainment weekly similarly thought dont tell mama was the strongest track but criticized the rest of the album as formulaic colin larkin of the virgin encyclopedia of country music thought this album had a shortage of standout material the albums closing track i know how the river feels was later a single in 1999 for diamond rio living in a moment was also certified gold in 1997big hopes herndons third album followed in 1998 doug johnson produced five of the tracks and byron gallimore best known for his work with tim mcgraw produced the other six herndon told the journal courier that he considered gallimore to have a more understated production style that put greater emphasis on his vocals than johnsons production did lead single a man holdin on to a woman lettin go one of the tracks produced by gallimore was a topfive country hit that same year after it came herndons third and final numberone single it must be love which also became his only top40 hit on the billboard hot 100 the song featured uncredited backing vocals from sons of the desert jack sundrud formerly of poco had cowritten it must be love for great plains another band he was a member of at the time when they did not record the song it became available for herndon hands of a working man was also a topfive country hit from big hopes walter allread of country standard time thought that the tracks produced by gallimore such as the title track were stronger due to their smaller production style relative to those produced by johnson thom owens of allmusic was mixed toward the album as he thought that it had filler tracks and glossy production although he praised herndons singing on a man holdin on and hands of a working man uncredited reviews of a man holdin on and hands of a working man in billboard were both favorable the former was praised for gallimores production and the unique perspectiveof men in difficult transitions while the latter was described as being appealing to working class listeners due to its lyrical focus on a fathers strugglesin 1999 epic released his next studio album steam herndon selected a new producer for this album as he thought his previous albums did not reflect the energy of his live performances he chose joe scaife because of that producers work with kt oslin a 1980s country artist herndon referred to as one of alltime favorites herndon selected the songs for the album by performing them in concert so he and scaife could gauge the audiences reaction to each in addition herndon recorded demos with his road band which he then played for the albums session musicians to give them an idea of how he wanted each song to sound among the involved musicians were drummer paul leim steel guitar player dan dugmore and guitarist chris leuzinger of garth brooks studio band the gmen the album also included a horn section fronted by jim horn and a string section including members of the nashville string machine steam the albums title track was also its lead single it reached top twenty by the end of 1999 but was less successful than the lead singles of herndons previous albums two other singles no mercy and a love like that peaked even loweralso included on the album was a cover of joe cockers you can leave your hat on which herndon had sung in concert for many years prior while not a single the cover charted at number 72 on hot country songs in 2000 due to unsolicited radio airplay herndon considered the album more sexy than his previous efforts citing both this cover and the title track as examples dan macintosh of country standard time considered herndon too darn polite for such material also criticizing the album for bythenumbers arrangements a more favorable review came from allmusic whose maria konicki dinoia wrote with a new production team in tow herndon has played a bigger part in selecting the albums songsand its clear he sings from the heart as he always has deborah evans price of billboard found both steam and no mercy equally sensuous in a review of the latterin late 2001 epic released the song heathers wall which was intended to be the lead single from herndons fifth album for the label at the time herndon was considering exiting the music business to star in a broadway theatre production of urban cowboy but decided against it paul worley the producer with whom he was working at the time recommended heathers wall to him when the two were selecting songs herndon originally rejected the song as too heavy but decided to record it after the september 11 attacks inspired him to record music again although the song was wellreceived by fans it was unsuccessful on the singles charts and his fifth epic album was not released epic then released a greatest hits package titled this is ty herndon greatest hits before dropping him from the label herndon released a christmas album a not so silent night in 2002 through his fan club and official website a year later the christmas album was repackaged with additional

drug and alcohol addictionhe returned to touring and singing in 2004 when songwriter darrell brown invited him to perform at the nashville nightclub bluebird café this led to him signing with titan pyramid records in 2006 and releasing the album right about now in early 2007 brown and herndon coproduced the album with songwriter dennis matkosky and session musician jonathan yudkin backing vocalists included marcus hummon joanna cotten emily west and thompson square thom jurek of allmusic reviewed the album favorably stating that herndons voice is not only unchanged from his missing years its stronger his phrasing is tighter and more expressive and his manner of handling a song is entirely his own one track from this album was a cover of johnny reids you still own me itself later a single in late 2007 for canadian country band emerson driveherndons next album was journey on released on the independent funl label in 2010 the album featured mostly contemporary christian music songs all of which herndon wrote or cowrote over the span of six months herndon said that he did not intend for the album to be a christian project but found that as he was writing many of the songs tended toward reflecting his spiritual growth he also said that he found the album fun because of how much control he had over assembling musicians and recording compared to his previous releases the album was nominated at the 53rd grammy awards for grammy award for best southern country or bluegrass gospel album journey on was selected by american football player kevin turner as the theme song for his kevin turner foundation this foundation is dedicated to research of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or lou gehrigs disease which turner had been recently diagnosed with at the time after journey on he released a nonalbum single titled stones which was previously recorded for his unreleased epic album in 2001 funl released the song to country radio without disclosing the artists name and held a contest with radio programmers to see if they could determine the singerthe album lies i told myself followed in 2013 also on funl prior to the albums release herndon had performed the title track in concert and chose to make it the lead single due to its positive reception from fans he also noted that the track beautiful love song had been written eight years prior and rejected by other artists but he chose to record it because he liked the sound of the songs demo another track on the album sugar was cowritten by country singer sara evanss brother matt evans herndon compared this track to steam and cited it as an example of the more modern sound he wanted on lies i told myself herndon financed the album through a kickstarter campaign and supported it by touring with jamie oneal and andy griggs matt bjorke of roughstock reviewed the album favorably praising herndons vocals on the ballads in particularhis next album was 2016s house on fire which once again featured several songs he cowrote it was his first release on the bfd label and he coproduced with drew davis and erik halbig a guitarist in herndons road band herndon described the title track as autobiographical while in comparison all night tonight came from davis and halbig wanting to write a beach song this was followed in 2019 by got it covered which featured rerecordings of his hit singles along with cover songs among the songs covered were marc cohns walking in memphis carrie underwoods so small and bonnie raitts i cant make you love me herndon said that he had almost considered retiring from country music due to the lack of success of his last few albums until he heard so small on the radio when underwood found that herndon had covered the song she spoke favorably about it on social media in 2020 herndon collaborated with kristin chenoweth and paul cardall on a single titled orphans of godherndons next single release was till you get there in june 2022 on pivotal records this was the lead single to his next studio album jacob released one month later it included more songs that herndon had written about his personal life country musicians terri clark emily west and shelly fairchild provided guest vocals on individual tracks as did jazz singer wendy moten herndon told spin that the albums title came from the account of jacob wrestling with the angel in the book of genesis this was followed in late 2022 by another single titled god or the gun which was accompanied by a music video the third single from the project was dents on a chevy a duet with terri clarkherndons singing voice has generally been met with critical favor stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic wrote of ty herndons musical style his earnest delivery was a good match for the kind of streamlined country he sang—music that didnt shun tradition but was aligned with the anthemic rockinfluenced arenacountry pioneered by garth brooks at the dawn of the 90s in a review of lies i told myself matt bjorke of roughstock wrote that tys always been at his best on the ballads and sings his ass off showcasing a vocal many of the young guns could learn from thom jurek of allmusic wrote that herndon has soul and plenty of it you can hear the gospel in his voice his love of the old country songs but his delivery is thoroughly contemporary an article from music city news magazine republished in the asheville citizentimes said of herndon there is a passion in his ballads and in the case ofi want my goodbye back an edgy emotional twist that sends listeners careening along with him dan macintosh described herndon as having straightwithnofrills singing walter allread wrote of herndon on the same site country music now resembles early sixties american pop with producers the real artists and singers merely interchangeable faces on record sleeves as long as ty herndons nice voice and face can front a hit hes good for another 100000 miles of touring and audio tapethe lyrical content of his epic albums was met with mixed reception michael mccall of new country found some of the tracks on what mattered most shallow such as in your face and heart half empty both entertainment weekly and allmusic panned living in a moment for formulaic lyrics in comparison herndon began writing songs in the 2010s although he had not written previously he thought that doing so would allow his albums to become more personalin june 1995 herndon was arrested in fort worth texas at gateway park by an undercover male police officer this officer alleged that herndon exposed himself when taken into custody herndon was also discovered to be in possession of methamphetamine herndon filed a plea bargain and was sentenced to community service and drug rehabilitation after which the charge of indecent exposure was droppedin 2002 herndon underwent a series of personal setbacks early in the year he was robbed at gunpoint in los angeles he also had a lawsuit filed against him by a california dentist claiming that herndon had not paid for emergency dental work and another lawsuit from a former manager for breach of contract in addition he relapsed into drug and alcohol addiction this led to him experiencing depression and weight gain after his friends noticed he had not left his apartment in several days they flew him to nashville where he lived in his mothers basement for one month before reentering rehabilitation after completing this he returned to performing in 2004 herndons addiction to methamphetamine resulted in a second relapse in 2020 at which point he was discovered in his apartment with both methamphetamine and ambien in his possession according to him this was the result of trauma from his first experience with metamphetamines at age 20 at which point he was raped this was an attempted suicide and would later serve as the inspiration behind his song god or the gun herndon successfully underwent drug rehabilitation a second time in late 2020early 2021 in addition to this herndon was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2021 in august 2022 herndon began a podcast called soundboard with ty herndon in which he discusses his personal life and mental health guests on the podcast have included singers leann rimes and michael rayherndon married renee posey on march 13 1993 the couple lived in dallas texas at the time but held their wedding in nashville during the 1990s posey worked as a registered nurse following herndons 1995 arrest his sexuality became a topic of interest within the country music industry as many presumed herndon to be gay at the time herndons manager told the advocate he did not know herndons orientation but thought country music was ready for an artist to come out as gay the editors of the encyclopedia of country music wrote of the exposure incident that it raised sexuality questions within the genre and that herndons continued commercial success throughout the rest of the 1990s indicated an unprecedented level of tolerance within the fandom herndon and posey divorced in 2002herndon came out as gay in a 2014 interview with people magazine thus becoming the first mainstream male country star to do so he stated that he had been in a gay relationship for several years at this point and that his exwife and several close family members already knew herndon was partnered with his boyfriend matt collum for eleven years before the two amicably separated in 2021 in relation to his coming out herndon reissued what mattered most in june 2019 with the songs pronouns changed to reflect a gay relationship this rerecording appeared on got it covered and herndon commented that he wished he could have recorded the song in that fashion at the time of its original release many of the songs on house on fire including the title track are about the stigmas that herndon felt he faced as a gay man in country music typically a more conservative genre he also credited conversations with country singer chely wright who came out as a lesbian in 2010 with giving him the confidence to come out another inspiration to herndon was hearing carrie underwoods so small on radio herndons announcement preceded the coming out of several other gay musicians in the genre such as billy gilman herndon noted that his fan base was largely supportive of him after his announcement herndon and wright have performed together at benefit concerts for glaad on multiple occasions in 2016 herndon and cmt presenter cody alan founded the concert for love and acceptance an annual concert to support lgbt youth in nashville in february 2023 herndon became engaged to alex schwartz whom he had been dating for six months prior they married on august 27 2023
