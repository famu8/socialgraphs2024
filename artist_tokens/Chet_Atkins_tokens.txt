wellwhen sholes took over pop production in 1957—a result of his success with elvis presley—he put atkins in charge of rca victors nashville division with country music record sales declining as rock and roll became more popular atkins took his cue from owen bradley and eliminated fiddles and steel guitar from many recordings though not all as a means of making country singers appeal to pop fans many of whom disliked the twang elements of country this became known as the nashville sound which atkins said was a label created by the media for a style of recording during that period intended to keep country and their jobs viableatkins used the jordanaires and a rhythm section on hits such as jim reevess four walls and hell have to go and don gibsons oh lonesome me and blue blue day the oncerare phenomenon of having a country hit cross over to pop success became more common he and bradley had essentially put the producer in the drivers seat guiding an artists choice of material and the musical background other nashville producers quickly copied this successful formula which resulted in certain country hits crossing over to find success in the pop fieldatkins made his own records which usually visited pop standards and jazz in a sophisticated home studio often recording the rhythm tracks at rca and adding his solo parts at home refining the tracks until the results satisfied him guitarists of all styles came to admire various atkins albums for their unique musical ideas and in some cases experimental electronic ideas in this period he became known internationally as mister guitar inspiring an album mister guitar engineered by both bob ferris and bill porter ferriss replacementat the end of march 1959 porter took over as chief engineer at what was at the time rca victors only nashville studio in the space that would become known as studio b after the opening of a second studio in 1965 at the time rcas sole nashville studio had no letter designation porter soon helped atkins get a better reverberation sound from the studios german effects device an emt plate reverb with his golden ear porter found the studios acoustics to be problematic and he devised a set of acoustic baffles to hang from the ceiling then selected positions for microphones based on resonant room modes the sound of the recordings improved significantly and the studio achieved a string of successes the nashville sound became more dynamic in later years when bradley asked how he achieved his sound atkins told him it was porter porter described atkins as respectful of musicians when recording—if someone was out of tune he would not single that person out by name instead he would say something like we got a little tuning problem everybody check and see whats going on if that did not work atkins would instruct porter to turn the offending player down in the mix when porter left rca in late1964 atkins said the sound was never the same never as greatatkinss trademark atkins style of playing uses the thumb and first two or sometimes three fingers of the right hand he developed this style from listening to merle travis occasionally on a primitive radio he was sure no one could play that articulately with just the thumb and index finger which was exactly how travis played and he assumed it required the thumb and two fingers—and that was the style he pioneered and masteredhe enjoyed jamming with fellow studio musicians and they were asked to perform at the newport jazz festival in 1960 that performance was cancelled because of rioting but a live recording of the group after the riot at newport was released atkins performed by invitation at the white house for every us president from john f kennedy through to george h w bush atkins was a member of the

john hartford to the label in the 1960s and inspired and helped countless others he took a considerable risk during the mid1960s when the civil rights movement sparked violence throughout the south by signing country musics first africanamerican singer charley pride who sang rawer country than the smoother music atkins had pioneeredatkinss biggest hit single came in 1965 with yakety axe an adaptation of yakety sax by his friend the saxophonist boots randolph he rarely performed in those days and eventually hired other rca producers such as bob ferguson and felton jarvis to lessen his workloadin the 1970s atkins became increasingly stressed by his executive duties he produced fewer records but could still turn out hits such as perry comos 1973 pop hit and i love you so he recorded extensively with close friend and fellow picker jerry reed who had become a hit artist in his own right a 1973 diagnosis of colon cancer however led atkins to redefine his role at rca records to allow others to handle administration while he went back to his first love the guitar often recording with reed or even jethro burns from homer and jethro his brotherinlaw after homer died in 1971 atkins would turn over his administrative duties to jerry bradley son of owen in 1973 at rcaatkins did little production work at rca after stepping down and in fact had hired producers at the label in the
