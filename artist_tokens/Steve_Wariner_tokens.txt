singles none of which appeared on an album at the time due to their limited success these singles were primarily covers of songs by other artists including charley prides the easy parts over record world magazine published a positive review of this cover which stated that it was a slow sad ballad in which wariner continues to show a whole lotta vocal talent atkins also hired wariner to be a bassist in his road band which led to a nomination by the academy of country music for bassist of the year in 1979 also atkins served as his record producer on his first single releases but later

fleming and dennis morgan the albums last two singles dont it break your heart and dont plan on sleeping tonight fared less successfully on the charts al campbell of allmusic stated that wariners sophisticated countrypop sound was already perfected and it showed by the quality of the material in 1980 the academy of country music nominated wariner for top new male vocalistrca released his

making the album wariner said that brown and bowen allowed him more control in the creative process than previous producers by asking him to find his own material and then explain to them why he liked each song that he had chosen the song selection process also allowed for a number of songwriters not typically found on albums of the era these writers included dave gibson ronnie rogers wood newton paul overstreet and steve earle stewart wrote that wariner takes a fresh approach to traditional country and melds a unique winning style highlighting the ballad you cant cut me any deeper and the grand pace of your love has got a hold on me in particularhis next album lifes highway 1986 produced two consecutive numberone hot country songs peaks you can dream of me and the title track this was followed by the number four starting over again wariner cowrote five songs on the album including you can dream of me which he wrote with john hall then of the band orleans as with the previous album bowen and brown requested that he have input on song selection and production processes one such decision made by wariner was not to have a string section on the album because he would not be able to include one in a live setting al campbell of allmusic reviewed the album favorably stating that it showed him moving into a more mature musical direction the best moments here outshine anything

albums impact quietly and methodically highlighting the vocal and instrumental performances on the singles in particular alanna nash of entertainment weekly rated the album b− concluding her review with if wariner lacks a zippy repertoire he nearly makes up for it with believable readings and deft vocal shadings jay brakfield of the dallas morning news thought that the album had contemporary
