festival in upstate new york and was the first major act signed to appear thereccr disbanded acrimoniously in late 1972 after four years of charttopping success tom fogerty had quit the band the year before and john was at odds with the remaining members over matters of business and artistic control all of which resulted in lawsuits among the former bandmates johns disagreements with fantasy records owner saul zaentz led to more court cases and john refused to perform with the two other surviving members of the band — tom had died in 1990 — at creedences 1993 induction into the rock and roll hall of fame though the band has never publicly reunited john continues to perform ccr songs as part of his solo act while cook and clifford performed as creedence clearwater revisited from 1995

worked at kewb oakland in 1964 they signed with fantasy records an independent jazz label in san francisco the band was attracted to the label after hearing vince guaraldis instrumental cast your fate to the wind which the label had released to national successfor the bands first release fantasy coowner max weiss renamed the group the golliwogs after the childrens literary character golliwog prior to the golliwog name weiss had renamed them vision bandmembers roles changed during this period cook switched from piano to bass guitar and tom fogerty from lead vocals to rhythm guitar john became the bands lead vocalist and primary songwriter in toms words i could sing but john had a sound for their work with this band tom took on the name rann wild and john became toby green both sides of each of the groups first six singles issued between 1964 and 1966 were credited to the writing team of wildgreen in 1966 john fogerty and doug clifford were drafted into the us armed forces fogerty joined the us army reserve while clifford joined the us coast guard reserve speaking of his experience in the us army fogerty has said i would become delirious and go into a trance and i started narrating this story to myself which was the song porterville john fogerty eventually took control of the group by singing lead vocals and blossoming into a multiinstrumentalist who played keyboards harmonica and saxophone in addition to lead guitar by 1967 he was producing the groups recordings although without credit the groups final single porterville failed to chart like every other golliwogs recording but the exact same recording was very shortly thereafter issued as a track by creedence clearwater revival on that groups first albumin 1967 saul zaentz bought fantasy records and offered the band a chance to record an album having hated the name the golliwogs from day one the band decided on their own name creedence clearwater revival ccr which they took in january 1968 according to interviews with the band members 20 years later the names elements came from three sources tom fogertys friend credence newball whose name they changed to form the word creedence as in creed a television commercial for olympia brewing company clear water and the four members renewed commitment to their band rejected contenders for the bands name included muddy rabbit gossamer wump and creedence nuball and the ruby however the last was the starting point from which the band derived their final name cook described the name as weirder than buffalo springfield or jefferson airplane in early 1968 the band began appearing regularly at local san francisco area clubs and venues including deno and carlos the avalon ballroom and the fillmore west later that year the band began touring nationally across the us and made their first appearances in new york city at the fillmore eastby 1968 am radio programmers around the us took note when ccrs cover of the 1956 rockabilly song susie q received substantial airplay in the san francisco bay area and on chicagos wlsam it was the bands second single its first to reach the top 40 no 11 and its only top 40 hit not written by john fogerty two other singles were released from their may 1968 debut self titled album a cover of screamin jay hawkinss i put a spell on you no 58 and porterville released on the scorpio label with writing credited to t spicebush swallowtail written during fogertys time in the army reserveafter their breakthrough ccr began touring and started work on their second album bayou country released january 1969 at rca studios in los angeles a no 7 platinum hit the record was their first in a string of hit albums and singles that continued uninterrupted for two years the single proud mary backed with born on the bayou reached no 2 on the national billboard chart the former would eventually become the groups mostcovered song with some 100 versions by other artists to date including the no 4 1971 hit by ike tina turner two years to the week after the original peaked john cites this song as being the result of high spirits on gaining his discharge from the army reserve the album also featured a cover of the rock roll classic good golly miss molly and the bands nineminute liveshow closer keep on chooglinmonths later during april 1969 bad moon rising backed with lodi was released and peaked at no 2 in the us in the united kingdom bad moon rising spent three weeks at number one on the uk singles chart during september and october 1969 becoming the bands only number one single in the uk the bands third album green river followed in august 1969 was their first album to top the billboard 200 and went gold along with the single green river which again reached no 2 on the billboard charts the bside of green river commotion peaked at no 30 and the bands emphasis on covers of their old favorites continued with night time is the right time ccr continued to tour constantly with performances in july 1969 at the atlanta pop festival and in august 1969 at the woodstock festival their set was not included in the woodstock film or soundtrack because john felt the bands performance was subpar four tracks from the event out of a total of eleven were eventually included in the 1994 commemorative box set woodstock three days of peace and music cook however held an opposing view saying the performances are classic ccr and im still amazed by the number of people who dont even know we were one of the headliners at woodstock 69 john later complained the act that preceded them the grateful dead had put the audience to sleep as john scanned the audience he saw a dante scene just bodies from hell all intertwined and asleep covered with mudcreedence clearwater revival were progressive and anachronistic at the same time an unapologetic throwback to the golden era of rock and roll they broke ranks with their peers on the progressive psychedelic san francisco scene their approach was basic and uncompromising holding true to the band members workingclass origins the term roots rock had not yet been invented when creedence came along but in essence they defined it drawing inspiration from the likes of little richard hank williams elvis presley chuck berry and the artisans of soul at motown and stax in so doing creedence clearwater revival became the standard bearers and foremost celebrants of homegrown american musicafter woodstock ccr were busy honing material for a fourth album willy and the poor boys their second top 3 lp released in november 1969 down on the corner and fortunate son both of which they performed on the ed sullivan show on november 16 1969 climbed to no 3 and no 14 respectively by years end the album was ccr in standard mode featuring fogerty originals and two reworked lead belly covers cotton fields and midnight special the year 1969 had been a remarkable chart year for the band three top ten albums four hit singles three charting at no 2 and one at no 3 with three additional charting bsidesccr released another double aside hit travelin bandwholl stop the rain in january 1970 the speedy travelin band with a strong little richard sound however bore enough similarities to good golly miss molly to warrant a lawsuit by the songs publisher it was eventually settled out of court the song ultimately topped out at no 2 the band also recorded its january 31 1970 live performance at the oakland coliseum arena which would later be marketed as a live album and television special in february ccr were featured on the cover of rolling stone although only john was interviewed in the accompanying articlein april 1970 ccr were set to begin their first european tour to support the upcoming live dates john wrote up around the bend and run through the jungle the single reached no 4 that spring the band returned to wally heider studios in san francisco in june to record cosmos factory the album contained the earlier top 10 hits travelin band and up around the bend plus popular album tracks such as the opener ramble tamblecosmos factory was released in july 1970 and it was number one in the us for nine weeks it was released along with the bands fifth and final no 2 national hit lookin out my back doorlong as i can see the light although they topped some international charts and local radio countdowns ccr have the distinction of having had five no 2 singles without ever having had a no 1 on the hot 100 the most of any group their five no 2 singles were exceeded only by madonna six taylor swift seven and drake nine and tied with elvis presley and the carpenters conversely on station wlsam the band had three no 1s four no 3s and two no 4s but no no 2 singles with down on the corner the only top ten ccr single registering the same peak position no 3 on the hot 100 and on wlsother cuts on the cosmos factory album included an 11minute jam of marvin gaye ’ s 1968 cover of i heard it through the grapevine a minor hit when an edited version was released as a single in 1976 and a nearly notefornote homage to roy orbisons ooby dooby the album was their biggest seller going to no 1 on the billboard 200 album charts and no 11 on billboards soul albums chartpendulum released in december 1970 was another top seller spawning a top 10 hit with have you ever seen the rain john played the hammond b3 organ on many of the pendulum tracks notably in have you ever seen the rain in recognition of the deep respect and influence of booker t the mgs with whom the members of the band had jammed the singles flip side hey tonight was also a hitaround this time an overwhelming perception among the other band members that john was being overly controlling and domineering was approaching a boiling point tom fogerty decided he had enough and resigned from ccr in early 1971 after the recording of pendulum with his departure being made public in february of that year the remaining members initially considered replacing him but ultimately continued as a trioin the spring of 1971 john fogerty frustrated with his remaining bandmates constant complaining that they were not allowed to write and produce their own songs relented and informed cook and clifford that ccr would continue only by adopting a democratic approach each member would now write and perform his own material with each band member contributing three songs apiece to the next album fogerty would only contribute guitar parts to his bandmates songs there are conflicting views regarding cook and cliffords reaction to this proposed new arrangement although everyone seemed to acknowledge that cook and clifford had wanted more input in ccrs artistic and business decisions for his part fogerty recounts that cook and clifford were initially excited about this new opportunity to write and perform their own songs free of his meddling since they had been the ones who asked for it in the first place and they only soured on the concept after the records lack of success fogerty also mentions a time while recording the album when he refused cooks request to fix one of his cooks songs to make it sound more like other creedence material which may have also played a role in the band members attitudes toward the project however other sources imply that cook and clifford were resistant to this approach from the start allegedly fogerty at one point insisted they accept the arrangement or he would quit the band despite the conflict the trio put its new work ethic to the test in the studio releasing the top 10 single sweet hitchhiker in july 1971 backed with cooks door to door the band toured both the us and europe that summer and fall with cooks song a part of the live set in spite of their continuing commercial success relations among the three had become increasingly strainedthe bands final album mardi gras was released in april 1972 featuring songs written by john fogerty cook and clifford as well as a cover of hello mary lou a song gene pitney had originally written for ricky nelson each member sang lead vocal on the songs written by that member the album was a critical failure considered by critics to be of inconsistent quality and lacking in cohesion rolling stone reviewer jon landau deemed it relative to a groups established level of performance the worst album i have ever heard from a major rock band the sales of mardi gras were weaker than previous albums ultimately peaking at no 12 though it still became the bands seventh consecutive studio album to be certified gold fogertys someday never comes backed with cliffords tearin up the country also cracked the us top 40by this point fogerty was not only at direct odds with his bandmates but he had also come to see the groups relationship with fantasy records as onerous feeling that zaentz had reneged on his promise to give the band a better contract cook—who held a degree in business—claimed that because of poor judgment on fogertys part ccr had to abide by the worst record deal of any major us recording artist despite the relatively poor reception of mardi gras and deteriorated relationships among the remaining band members ccr embarked upon a twomonth 20date us tour however on october 16 1972—less than six months after the tour ended—fantasy records and the band officially announced its disbanding ccr never formally reunited after the breakup although cook and clifford eventually started the band creedence clearwater revisited john fogerty later commented on the demise of ccr in a 1997 edition of the swedish magazine popi was alone when i made that music i was alone when i made the arrangements i was alone when i added background vocals guitars and some other stuff i was alone when i produced and mixed the albums the other guys showed up only for rehearsals and the days we made the actual recordings for me creedence was like sitting on a time bomb wed had decent successes with our cover of susie q and with the first album when we went into the studio to cut proud mary it was the first time we were in a real hollywood studio rcas los angeles studio and the problems started immediately the other guys in the band insisted on writing songs for the new album they had opinions on the arrangements they wanted to sing they went as far as adding background vocals to proud mary and it sounded awful they used tambourines and it sounded no betterthats when i understood i had a choice to make at that point in time we were just a one hit wonder and susie q hadnt really been that big a hit either this would be a success something really big or we might as well start working at the car wash again there was a big row we went to an italian restaurant and i remember that i very clearly told the others that i for one didnt want to go back to the car wash again now we had to make the best possible album and it wasnt important who did what as long as the result was the very best we could achieve and of course i was the one who should do it i dont think the others really understood what i meant but at least i could manage the situation the way i wanted the result was eight millionselling doublesided singles in a row and six albums who all went platinum and melody maker had us as the best band in the world that was after the beatles split but still and i was the one who had created all this despite that i dont think they understood what i was talking about they were obsessed with the idea of more control and more influence so finally the bomb exploded and we never worked together againin 1973 john fogerty began his solo career with the blue ridge rangers his oneman band collection of country and gospel songs under his old ccr contract however fogerty owed fantasy eight more records in the end he refused to work for the label the impasse was resolved only when asylum records david geffen bought fogertys contract for 1 million in 1975 he released his only asylum album the selftitled john fogerty his next major hit was centerfield a charttopping success in 1985 on tour in 1986 however fogerty suffered complaints over his steadfast refusal to perform ccr songs and suffered with recurring vocal problems which he blamed on having to testify in court fogertys explanation for not playing ccr material was that he would have had to pay performance royalties to copyright holder zaentz and that it was too painful to revisit the music of his pastwith the centerfield album fogerty also found himself entangled in new titfortat lawsuits with zaentz over the song the old man down the road which was according to zaentz a blatant rewrite of fogertys own 1970 ccr hit run through the jungle since fogerty had traded his rights to ccrs songs in 1980 to cancel his remaining contractual obligations fantasy now owned the rights to run through the jungle and sued fogerty essentially for plagiarizing himself while a jury ruled in fogertys favor he did settle a defamation suit filed by zaentz over the songs mr greed and zanz kant danz fogerty was forced to edit the recording changing the zanz reference to vanzon february 19 1987 at the palomino club north hollywood in los angeles fogerty broke his selfimposed ban on performing ccr hits bob dylan and george harrison along with taj mahal and jesse ed davis had joined him onstage admonishing if you dont the whole worlds gon na think proud mary is tina turners song at a 1987 independence day benefit concert for vietnam veterans fogerty finally ran through the list of ccr hits beginning with born on the bayou and ending with proud mary in 1986 he also released his second warner bros album eye of the zombie fogerty retreated from music again in the late 1980s but returned in 1997 with the grammywinning blue moon swamp fogerty still tours frequently and now performs ccr classics alongside his solo materialtom fogerty released several solo albums though none reached the success of ccr his 1974 solo album zephyr national was the last to feature the four original ccr band members on the track mystic isle of avalon although john recorded his parts separately several tracks sound very much like the ccr style particularly the aptly titled joyful resurrection his album excalibur featured all four members of the jerry garcia band who recorded live albums for fantasy garcia played lead guitar to toms rhythm guitar and has since become a popular cult albumtom fogerty died at his home in scottsdale arizona in september 1990 of an aids complication which he contracted via a tainted blood transfusion he received while undergoing back surgery tom and john barely reconciled before toms death and in the eulogy that he delivered at toms funeral john said we wanted to grow up and be musicians i guess we achieved half of that becoming rock n roll stars we didnt necessarily grow upjunior high school friends doug clifford and stu cook continued to work together following the demise of ccr both as session players and members of the don harrison band they also founded factory productions a mobile recording service in the bay area clifford released a solo record cosmo in 1972 cook produced artist roky ericksons the evil one and was a bassist with the popular country act southern pacific in the 1980sclifford also produced groovers paradise for former sir douglas quintet and texas tornados frontman doug sahm both clifford and cook played on the album which was released on warner bros in 1974 clifford continued to perform and record with sahm through the 1980sfollowing a relatively long period of musical inactivity cook and clifford formed creedence clearwater revisited in 1995 with several wellknown musicians revisited continues to tour globally performing the original bands classics johns 1997 injunction forced creedence clearwater revisited to temporarily change its name to cosmos factory but the courts later ruled in cooks and cliffords favorafter ccr fantasy records released several greatesthits packages such as 1972s creedence gold 1973s more creedence gold and 1975s precreedence a compilation album of the golliwogs early recordings fantasy also released the highly successful double album chronicle a collection of creedences twenty hit singles in 1976 several years later the label released a live recording entitled the royal albert hall concert contrary to its title the 1970 performance was recorded in oakland california not at the royal albert hall in london subsequent issues of the original 1981 album have been retitled simply the concert another double album of their best material was issued in 1986 as chronicle volume twothe success of ccr made fantasy and zaentz a great deal of money and fantasy built a new headquarters building in 1971 at 2600 tenth street in berkeley california zaentz also used his wealth to produce a number of successful films including best picture oscar winners one flew over the cuckoos nest amadeus and the english patientin 2004 zaentz sold fantasy to concord records john fogerty then purchased from concord a majority stake in the global rights to the creedence clearwater revival songs he had written in 2005 the label released the long road home a collection of ccr and fogerty solo classics after revival came out on the fantasy label in october 2007 but before his following album blue ridge rangers rides again a sequel to his 1973 album was issued in 2009 fogerty switched from fantasy to his own label fortunate son records distributed by verve forecast recordsthe original ccr lineup reunited just once for a performance after their breakup at tom fogertys wedding on october 19 1980 six years prior all four members were present on the song mystic aisle avalon on toms 1974 album zephyr national but john recorded his parts separately from everyone else john cook and clifford played at their 20th el cerrito high school reunion in 1983 but as their original incarnation the blue velvets in the 1980s and 1990s new rounds of lawsuits between the band members as well as against their former management deepened their animosities by the time ccr was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1993 john refused to perform with cook and clifford the pair were barred from the stage while john played with an allstar band that included bruce springsteen and robbie robertson toms widow tricia had expected a ccr reunion and even brought the urn containing her husbands ashes to the ceremony furious cook and clifford who were seated with their families at a table across the room from fogertys walked out of the ballroom just as the performance began and would later write separate letters to the rock and roll hall of fames board of directors saying it was hurtful and insulting to allow the performance to continue without themin a july 2011 interview with the calgary herald john admitted that he would at least be willing to consider reuniting with cook and cliffordyears ago i looked at people and i was so full of some sort of emotion and id say absolutely not but i have to admit people have asked me more recently and even though i have no idea how such a series of events would come to pass i can tell that there isnt the bombast in my voice in the denial in the refusal its more like well i dunno never say never is i guess is what people tell you in this life all kinds of strange things come to pass realizing that it doesnt really kick up a big firestorm of emotion it kind of suggests that at least if someone started talking id sit still long enough to listenwhen asked again in october 2011 about the prospect of a reunion he said im saying its possible yeah i think the call would maybe have to come from outside the realm somebody would have to get me to look at things in a fresh way however cook and clifford both stated in the february 2012 edition of uncut magazine that they are not interested in a ccr reunion leopards dont change their spots this is just an imagepolishing exercise by john my phone certainly hasnt rung cook said added clifford it might have been a nice idea twenty years ago but its too latein may 2013 fogerty once again said he would be open to a reunion but he does not see cook and clifford being willing to change their stance he told charlie rose on cbs this morning from time to time ill say something and itll get in print that maybe that will happen and then immediately ill hear back stuff that doesnt sound like its possible i think its a possibility in the future you know its not something im actively seeking but im not totally against the idea either in september 2017 clifford again ruled out any chance of cook and himself reuniting with john restating it would have been great twenty twentyfive years ago its way too late nowdespite hailing from california ccr mythologized the american south with an exotic mixture of blues new orleans rb and rockabilly according to npr according to allmusic ccr created a unique synthesis of punchy rock roll swamp pop blues and country ccr has been cited as pioneers of swamp rock and country rock the band also played roots rock blues rock and southern rock the band often utilized lyrics about bayous catfish the mississippi river and other elements of southern united states iconography the bands songs rarely dealt with romantic love concentrating instead on political and socially conscious lyrics about topics such as the vietnam warccrs catalog of songs has frequently been used or referenced in popular culture partly because john fogerty signed away legal control of his old recordings to the bands record label fantasy records in an npr interview fogerty objected to what he regarded as a misuse of his musicfolks will remember forrest gump and that was a great movie but they dont remember all the really poor movies that fantasy records stuck creedence music into car commercials tire commercials im remembering a paint thinner ad at one point the song wholl stop the rain oh boy thats clever isnt itof particular interest was the use of his protest song fortunate son in a blue jeans commercial in this case the advertiser eventually stopped using the song as fogerty related in a later interviewyes the people that owned fantasy records also owned all my early songs and they would do all kinds of stuff i really hated in a commercial way with my songs then one day somebody from the la times actually bothered to call me up and ask me how i felt and i finally had a chance to talk about it and i said im very much against my song being used to sell pants so my position got stated very well in the newspaper and lo and behold wrangler to their credit said wow even though we made our agreement with the publisher the owner of the song we can see now that john fogerty really hates the idea so they stopped doing itrolling stone ranked ccr 82nd on its 100 greatest artists of all timein 2003
