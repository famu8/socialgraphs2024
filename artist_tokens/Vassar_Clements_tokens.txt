them both out the guitar was pretty easy but i couldnt get nothing out of the fiddle so every time id see those instruments sitting side by side id grab that fiddlebig band and swing music were considerable influences upon his style and musical development and he said that bands like glenn miller les brown tommy dorsey harry james and artie shaw were very popular when i was a kid i always
