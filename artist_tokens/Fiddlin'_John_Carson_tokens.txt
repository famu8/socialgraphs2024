june 1923 polk c brockman an atlanta furniture store owner who had been instrumental in the distribution of records for okeh records went to new york city to work out a new business deal with okeh records later in new york he was asked if he knew of any artist in atlanta that could justify a recording trip to georgia brockman promised to return with an answer a few days later he was watching a movie followed by a silent newsreel at the palace theater in times square the newsreel contained footage of carson from an old time fiddlers contest in virginia brockman wrote in his notebook record fiddlin john carson at his next meeting with okeh records board he persuaded ralph peer to go ahead and record carsonon june 19 1923 carson made his recording debut in an empty building on nassau street in atlanta cutting two sides the little old log cabin in the lane and the old hen cackled and the roosters going to crow brockman told researchers in the 1960s that peer had disliked the singing style of carson and described it pluperfect awful but peer was persuaded by brockman to press five hundred copies for him to distribute peers biographer barry mazor argues that peers dissatisfaction concerned the technical quality of the recording rather than the music and that peer was keen to make more recordings of carson in new york the recording was immediately sold out from the stage of the next fiddlers convention on july 13 1923 peer realizing carsons potential immediately invited carson to new york city for another recording session his recordings of you will never
