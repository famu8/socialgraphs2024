bresh 1948–2022 had continued playing in traviss style on a custommade langejans dualettealthough his early tutors were among the first to use the thumbpick in guitar playing freeing the fingers to pick melody travis style according to chet atkins went on in musical directions never dreamt about by his predecessors his trademark mature style incorporated elements from ragtime blues boogie jazz and western swing and was marked by rich chord progressions harmonics slides and bends and rapid changes of key he could shift quickly from fingerpicking to flatpicking in the midst of a number by gripping his thumbpick like a flat pick in his hands the guitar resembled a full band as his son thom bresh puts it on first hearing his father as a child i thought it was just the coolest sound because it sounded like a whole bunch of instruments coming from one guitar in it i heard rhythm parts i heard melodies i heard chords and all this wrapped up in one equally at home on acoustic and electric guitar travis was one of the first to exploit the full range of techniques and sonorities available on the electric guitarthough chet atkins was the most prominent guitarist to be inspired by merle travis the two players styles were significantly different as atkins explained while i play alternate bass strings which sounds more like a stride piano style merle played two bass strings simultaneously on the one and three beats producing a more exciting solo rhythm in my opinion it was somewhat reminiscent of the great old black players the resemblance was no coincidence travis himself acknowledged the influence of black guitarists such as blind blake the foremost ragtime and blues guitarist of the late 1920s and early 1930stravis style is explained and exemplified by marcel dadi on the dvd the guitar of merle travis which includes live video performances by travis of classics such as john henry and nine pound hammer as well as transcriptions of travis solos in
