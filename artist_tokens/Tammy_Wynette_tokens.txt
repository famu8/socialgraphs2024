clinton who had been accused of infidelity hillary clinton said im not sitting here as some little woman standing by my man like tammy wynette the end of this quotation has also appeared as some little woman standing by my man and baking cookies like tammy wynette however the reference to cookiebaking more likely comes from an unrelated remark by hillary clinton i suppose i could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas but what i decided to do was to fulfill my profession which i entered before my husband was in public life the remark received widespread media and press attention wynette wrote to clinton saying with all that is in me i resent your caustic remark i believe you have offended every true countrymusic fan and every person who has made it on their own with no one to

the road before concerts however her adhesions continued and wynette had a series of operations to stop them from forming she then was being prescribed more painkillers which caused a drug addiction starting in the seventies along with valium wynette also was prescribed demerol to alleviate her stomach cramps and in time began taking the drug when she was not in pain when demerol pills became ineffective in warding off symptoms of withdrawal she resorted to taking demerol by injection members of her road crew administered some of these injections after one of wynettes doctors trained them how to do so wynettes doctors soon realized that she had grown addicted to the medication they had prescribed and ceased giving prescriptions in turn wynette found other physicians in various locations around the united states who would unwittingly give her the same prescriptions some nights on the road wynette scheduled overnight stops of the tour bus at hospitals where she could acquire yet more pain killers during this period wynette also underwent surgeries to remove nodules on her vocal cords and a surgery for a kidney problemwynettes drug problem became public for the first time in november 1986 when she announced she would enter the betty ford center for treatment her public appearances were then canceled until the start of 1987 three weeks into the sixweek treatment program wynette began having stomach pain following an afternoon meal she was then hospitalized for an intestinal blockage the blockage revealed that previous surgeries had caused a narrowing of the area where food left her stomach she then had an eighthour operation where she said 25 percent of her stomach was removed she was then put back on the same drugs to alleviate the pain which reinstated her addiction to painkillerswynette continued abusing painkillers into the nineties during this time she started taking dilaudid for pain wynette often carried the drug in her purse in 1993 she entered

recording stand by your man was often considered to be about women remaining faithful to their husbands through difficult times mary a bufwack and robert k oermann stated that the song typecast tammy as the longsuffering housewife forlornly putting up with abuse for the sake of love jon pareles wrote in 1998 that it established ms wynette in the role of a longsuffering but determinedly loyal wife holding the family together even when her husband strayedthe song and its concept drew criticism as well including from the womens liberation movement who were gaining political traction when the single was released in 1968 many feminists criticized it for influencing housewives to view themselves as subservient to their husbands sherrill explained to the wall street journal his reasons for composing it i reworked the lyrics so the story came from the perspective of a woman singing to another woman—as if she were giving advice to a friend who was a little unsure about how to hold on to her man all i wanted to say in the song was be understanding be supportive wynette herself later commentedthe song helped develop a sound and style that made her commercially successful in the next several years following stand by your man number one singles such as singing my song ill see him through the ways to love a man and he loves me all the way followed similar themes about housewives staying faithful to their husbands while she was often stereotyped for only recording songs about housewives her song choices reflected various feminine perspectives the 1967 single your good girls gon na go bad warned a husband that his wife will start behaving like the rowdy women he interacts with at the bar in the 1982 single another chance a woman chooses not to take her partner back after
