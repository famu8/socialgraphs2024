just hardwiring synapses in your brain up until the age of maybe 12 or 10 and there are certain things you cant learn in an authentic way after that—linda ronstadtronstadts early family life was filled with music and tradition which influenced the stylistic and musical choices she later made in her career growing up she listened to many types of music including mexican music which was sung by her entire family and was a staple in her childhoodronstadt has remarked that all the styles she has recorded on her own records – rock and roll rhythm and blues gospel opera country choral and mariachi – are music she heard her family sing in their living room or heard played on the radio by the age of 10 she credits her mother for her appreciation of gilbert and sullivan and her father for introducing her to the traditional pop and great american songbook repertoire that she would in turn help reintroduce to an entire generationif i didnt hear it on the radio or if my dad wasnt playing it on the piano or if my brother wasnt playing it on the guitar or singing it in his boys choir or my mother and sister werent practicing a broadway tune or a gilbert and sullivan song then i cant do it today its as simple as that all of my influences and my authenticity are a direct result of the music played in that tucson living room—linda ronstadtearly on her singing style had been influenced by singers such as lola beltrán and édith piaf she has called their singing and rhythms more like greek music its sort of like 68 time signature very hard driving and very intense she also drew

combined cajun and swamp rock elements in their music its members included cajun fiddler gib guilbeau and john beland who later joined the flying burrito brothers as well as stan pratt thad maxwell

her selftitled third album from which a failed single ronstadts version of brownes rock me on the water was drawn at this stage ronstadt began working with producer and boyfriend john boylan she said as soon as i started working with john boylan i started coproducing myself i was always a part of my productions but i always needed a producer who would carry out my whims also in 1971 ronstadt began talking with david geffen about moving from capitol records to geffens asylum records labelin 1975 ronstadt performed shows with jackson browne the eagles and toots and the maytals in these shows she would sing lead vocal on numerous songs including the eagles desperado while singing background and playing tambourine and acoustic guitar on othersseveral years before ronstadt became what author gerri hirshey called the first arenaclass rock diva with hugely anticipated tours she began her solo career touring the north american concert circuitbeing on the road took its toll both emotionally and professionally in a 1976 rolling stone interview with cameron crowe ronstadt said they havent invented a word for that loneliness that everybody goes through on the road the world is tearing by you real fast and all these people are looking at you people see me in my girlsinger suit in 1974 she told peter knobler in crawdaddy people are always taking advantage of you everybody thats interested in you has got an anglethere were few girl singers on the rock circuit at the time and they were relegated to groupie level when in a crowd of a bunch of rock and roll guys a status ronstadt avoided relating to men on a professional level as fellow musicians led to competition insecurity bad romances and a series of boyfriendmanagers at the time she admired singers like maria muldaur for not sacrificing their femininity but says she felt enormous selfimposed pressure to compete with the boys at every level she noted in a 1969 interview in fusion magazine that it was difficult being a single chick singer with an allmale backup band according to her it was difficult to get a band of backing musicians because of their ego problem of being labeled sidemen for a female singerin general when you fall in love with an artist and their music the plan is a fairly simple one get people to go and see them and make a record that you think properly presents their music to the public and some of which you can get on the radio—peter asher on collaborating with ronstadtronstadt began her fourth solo album dont cry now in 1973 with boylan who had negotiated her contract with asylum records and john david jd souther producing most of the albums tracks but needing someone willing to work with her as an equal ronstadt asked peter asher who came highly recommended to her by james taylors sister kate taylor to help produce two of them sail away and i believe in youthe album featured ronstadts first country hit silver threads and golden needles which she had first recorded on hand sown home grown – this time hitting the country top 20with the release of dont cry now ronstadt took on her biggest gig to date as the opening act on neil youngs time fades away tour playing for larger crowds than ever before backstage at a concert in texas chris hillman introduced her to emmylou harris telling them you two could be good friends which soon occurred resulting in frequent collaborations over the following years meanwhile the album became ronstadts most successful up to that time selling 300000 copies by the end of 1974asher turned out to be more collaborative and more on the same page with her musically than any producer she had worked with previously ronstadts professional relationship with asher allowed her to take command and effectively delegate responsibilities in the recording studio although hesitant at first to work with her because of her reputation for being a woman of strong opinions who knew what she wanted to do with her career he nonetheless agreed to become her fulltime producer and remained in that role through the late 1980s asher attributed the longterm success of his working relationship with ronstadt to the fact that he was the first person to manage and produce her with whom there was a solely professional relationship it must be a lot harder to have objective conversations about someones career when its someone you sleep with he saidasher executiveproduced a tribute cd called listen to me buddy holly released on september 6 2011 on which ronstadts 1976 version of buddy hollys thatll be the day appears among newly recorded versions of hollys songs by various artistsi grew up singing mexican music and thats based on indigenous mexican rhythms mexican music also has an overlay of west african music based on huapango drums and its kind of like a 68 time signature but it really is a very syncopated 68 and thats how i attack vocals—linda ronstadt on reconciling her musical instincts with rock n rollronstadt captured the sounds of country music and the rhythms of ranchera music – which she likened in 1968 to mexican bluegrass – and redirected them into her rock n roll and some of her pop music many of these rhythms and sounds were part of her southwestern roots likewise a country sound and style a fusion of country music and rock n roll called country rock started to exert its influence on mainstream pop music around the late 1960s and it became an emerging movement ronstadt helped form and commercialize however as early as 1970 ronstadt was being criticized by music purists for her brand of music which crossed many genres country western stars magazine wrote in 1970 that rock people thought she was too gentle folk people thought she was too pop and pop people didnt quite understand where she was at but country people really loved linda she never categorized herself and stuck to her genrecrossing brand of musicronstadt is considered an interpreter of her times and has earned praise for her courage to put her stamp on many of her songs ronstadt herself has indicated that some of her 1970s hits were recorded under considerable pressure to create commercially successful recordings and that she prefers many of her songs that were nonhit album tracks an infrequent songwriter ronstadt cocomposed only three songs over her long career ronstadts natural vocal range spans several octaves from contralto to soprano and occasionally she will showcase this entire range within a single work ronstadt was the first female artist in popular music history to accumulate four consecutive platinum albums fourteen certified million selling to date as for the singles rolling stone pointed out that a whole generation but for her might never have heard the work of artists such as buddy holly elvis costello and chuck berrymusic is meant to lighten your load by singing it you release the sadness and release yourself an exercise in exorcism you exorcise that emotion and diminish sadness and feel joy—linda ronstadtothers have argued that ronstadt had the same generational effect with her great american songbook music exposing a whole new generation to the music of the 1920s and 1930s – music which was pushed aside because of the advent of rock n roll when interpreting ronstadt said she sticks to what the music demands in terms of lyrics explaining that rock and roll music is part of her culture she says that the songs she sang after her rock and roll hits were part of her soul the mariachi music was my fathers side of the soul she was quoted as saying in a 1998 interview she gave at her tucson home my mothers side of my soul was the nelson riddle stuff and i had to do them both to reestablish who i wasin the 1974 book rock n roll woman author katherine orloff writes that ronstadts own musical preferences run strongly to rhythm and blues the type of music she most frequently chooses to listen to and her goal is to be soulful too with this in mind ronstadt fuses country and rock into a special unionby this stage of her career ronstadt had established her niche in the field of countryrock along with other musicians such as the flying burrito brothers emmylou harris gram parsons swampwater neil young and the eagles she helped free country music from stereotypes and showed rockers that country was okay however she stated that she was being pushed hard into singing more rock and rollauthor andrew greeley in his book god in popular culture described ronstadt as the most successful and certainly the most durable and most gifted woman rock singer of her era signaling her wide popularity as a concert artist outside of the singles charts and the recording studio dirty linen magazine describes her as the first

top 10 everly brothers song – hit number 1 in cashbox and number 2 in billboard the song was also ronstadts first number 1 country hitthe albums critical and commercial success was due to a fine

internationally reaching number 1 on the australian and canadian pop and country albums charts simple dreams also made ronstadt the most successful international female touring artist the same year she completed a concert tour around europe as country music magazine wrote in october 1978 simple dreams solidified ronstadts role as easily the most successful female rock and roll and country star at this timealso in 1977 she was asked by the los angeles dodgers to sing the us national anthem at game three of the world series against the new york yankeesronstadt said she was artificially encouraged to kinda cop a really tough attitude and be tough because rock and roll is kind of tough business female rock artists like her and janis joplin whom she described as lovely shy and literate in real life and the antithesis of the red hot mamma she was artificially encouraged to project went through an identity crisisby the mid1970s ronstadts image became just as famous as her music in 1976 and 1977 she appeared on the covers of rolling stone and time the rolling stone cover story was accompanied by a series of photographs of ronstadt in a skimpy red slip taken by annie leibovitz ronstadt felt deceived not realizing that the photos would be so revealing she says her manager peter asher kicked leibovitz out of the house when she visited to show them the photographs prior to publication leibovitz had refused to let them veto any of the photos which included one of ronstadt sprawled across a bed in her underpants in a 1977 interview ronstadt explained annie saw that picture as an exposé of my personality she was right but i wouldnt choose to show a picture like that to anybody who didnt know me personally because only friends could get the other sides of me in balanceher 1977 appearance on the cover time under the banner torchy rock was also upsetting to ronstadt considering what the image appeared to project about the most famous woman in rock at a time in the industry when men still told women what to sing and what to wear ronstadt hated the image of her that was projected to the world on that cover and she noted how the photographer kept forcing her to wear a dress which was an image she did not want to project in 2004 she was interviewed for cbs this morning and stated that this image was not her because she did not sit like that asher noted anyone whos met linda for 10 seconds will know that i couldnt possibly have been her svengali shes an extremely determined woman in every area to me she was everything that feminisms about qualities which asher has stated were considered a negative in a woman at that time whereas in a man they were perceived as being masterful and bold since her solo career had begun ronstadt had fought hard to be recognized as a solo female singer in the world of rock and her portrayal on the time cover did not appear to help the situationin 1978 rolling stone declared ronstadt by far americas bestknown

and started to branch out and been doing that ever since by 1983 her estimated worth was over 40 million mostly from records concerts and merchandisingin the early 1980s ronstadt was criticized for accepting 500000 to perform at the south african resort sun city violating the cultural boycott imposed against south africa because of its policy of apartheid at the time she stated the last place for a boycott is in the arts and i dont like being told i cant go somewhere paul simon was criticized for including her on his 1986 album graceland recorded in south africa but defended her i know

producer jerry wexler however ronstadts displeasure with the result led her with regrets to scrap the project doing that killed me she said in a time magazine interview but the appeal of the albums music had seduced ronstadt as she told downbeat in april 1985 crediting wexler for encouraging her nonetheless ronstadt had to convince her reluctant record company elektra to approve this type of album under her contractby 1983 ronstadt had enlisted the help of 62yearold conductor nelson riddle the two embarked on an unorthodox and original approach to rehabilitating the great american songbook recording a trilogy of traditional pop albums whats new 1983‍—‌us 37 million as of 2010 lush life 1984‍—‌us 17 million as of 2010 and for sentimental reasons 1986‍—‌us 13 million as of 2010 the three albums have had a combined sales total of nearly seven million copies in the us alonei now realize i was taking a tremendous risk and that joe smith the head of elektra records and strongly opposed was looking out for himself and for me when it became apparent i wouldnt change my mind he said i love nelson so much can i please come to the sessions i said yes when the albums were successful joe congratulated me and i never said i told you so—linda ronstadtthe album design for whats new by designer kosh was unlike any of her previous disc covers it showed ronstadt in a vintage dress lying on shimmering satin sheets with a walkman headset at the time ronstadt received some chiding for both the album cover and her venture into what was then considered elevator music by cynics but remained determined to record with riddle and whats new became a hit the album was released in september 1983 and spent 81 weeks on the billboard album chart and held the number three position for a month and a half held out of the top spot only by michael jacksons thriller and lionel richies cant slow down and the riaa certified it triple platinum over three million copies sold in the us alone

the yearronstadt faced considerable pressure not to record whats new or record with riddle according to jazz historian peter levinson author of the book september in the rain – a biography on nelson riddle joe smith president of elektra records was terrified that the riddle album would turn off ronstadts rock audience ronstadt did not completely turn her back on her rock and roll past however the video for the title track featured danny kortchmar as the old beau that she bumped into during a rainstormwhats new brought riddle to a younger audience according to levinson the younger audience hated what riddle had done with frank sinatra which in 1983 was considered vintage pop working with ronstadt riddle brought his career back into focus in the last three years of his life stephen holden of the new york times wrote whats new isnt the first album by a rock singer to pay tribute to the golden age of the pop but is the best and most serious attempt to rehabilitate an idea of pop that beatlemania and the mass marketing of rock lps for teenagers undid in the mid60s in the decade prior to beatlemania most of the great band singers and crooners of the 40s and 50s codified a halfcentury of american pop standards on dozens of albums many of them now long outofprint whats new is the first album by a rock singer to have major commercial success in rehabilitating the great american songbookin 1984 ronstadt and riddle performed these songs live in concert halls throughout australia japan and the united states including multinight performances at historic venues carnegie

myself had sold over 75000 copies in the us as of 2010 it also achieved some critical acclaim from the jazz cognoscentiwhen we sang it was a beautiful and different sound ive never heard before we
