pushed him onto the stage carlone was so impressed with comos performance that he immediately offered him a jobcomo was not certain if he should accept carlones offer so he returned to canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father como expected his father would tell him to stay in the barber business but to his surprise his father said if he did not take the opportunity he might never know whether or not he could be a professional singer the decision was also made with an eye on finances at this time como was earning around 125 per week from his barber shop while the job with carlone paid 28 per week roselle was willing to travel with her fiancé and the band but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road perry and roselle were married in meadville on july 31 1933 four days later como joined carlones band and began working with them roselle returned home to canonsburg como would be on the road for the next 18 monthsthree years after joining carlone como moved to ted weemss orchestra and his first recording dates como and weems met in 1936 while the carlone orchestra was playing in warren ohio como initially did not take the offer to join weemss orchestra apparently realizing it was the best move for como carlone selflessly urged him to sign with weems art jarrett had just left the weems organization to start his own band weems was in need of a vocalist como got a raise weems paid him 50 per week his first chance for nationwide exposure weems and his orchestra were based in chicago and were regulars on the jack benny program and fibber mcgee

affiliate wgn radio threatened to stop carrying the weems broadcasts from chicagos palmer house if his new singer did not improve weems had recordings of some of his previous radio programs one evening he and como listened to them and como was shocked to realize no one could understand the lyrics when he sang weems told como there was no need for him to resort to vocal tricks what was necessary was to sing from the heartcomos first recording with the weems band was a novelty tune called you cant pull the wool over my eyes recorded for the decca records label in may 1936 during one of comos early decca recording sessions with the weems orchestra weems was told to get rid of that kid como because he sounded too much like bing crosby who also recorded for decca before como could reply weems spoke up saying como was part of the session or it was over by the time como had been with weems about a year he was mentioned in a 1937 life magazine nbc radio ad for fibber mcgee and molly as causing cardiac flutters with his crooning the weekly radio show beat the band which ran on nbc from 19401944 was a stump the bandtype musical quiz show on which weems and his orchestra were featured from 1940 to 1941the comos first child ronnie was born in 1940 while the weems band was working in chicago como left to be at his wifes side though he was threatened with dismissal if he did so though como was now making 250 a week and travel expenses for the family were no problem ronnie could not become used to a normal routine when they were unable to stay in one place for a period of time the radio program beat the band did not always originate from chicago but was often broadcast from other cities such as milwaukee denver and st louis the band continued to play road engagements while part of the program was broadcast como decided life on the road was no place to raise a child and roselle and the baby went back to canonsburgin late 1942 como decided to quit the weems band even if it meant giving up singing weary of life on the road and missing his wife and son he returned to canonsburg his family and his trade como received an offer to become a frank sinatra imitator but chose to keep his own style while como was negotiating for a store lease to reopen a barber shop he received a call from tommy rockwell at general artists corporation who also represented weems como fielded many other calls that also brought offers but he liked and trusted rockwell who was offering him his own sustaining unsponsored columbia broadcasting system cbs radio show and promising to get him a recording contract the offers were also appealing because it meant staying put in new york with no more road tours as como pondered the job offer roselle told him you can always get another barber shop if it doesnt work out until the radio show and recording contract offers he did not view singing as his true career believing the years with carlone and weems had been enjoyable but now it was time to get back to work como said in a 1983 interview i thought id have my fun and id go home to workperry made his debut radio broadcast for cbs on march 12 1943 rockwells next move was to book como into the renowned copacabana nightclub for two weeks beginning on june 10 1943 at this same time rca victor was looking for a crooner to compete with sinatra and crosby como signed his first recording contract with rca victor and three days after that cut his first record for the company goodbye sue it was the beginning of a professional relationship that lasted for 44 years he became a very successful performer in theater and nightclub engagements comos initial two weeks at the copacabana in june stretched into august sinatra would sometimes call como and ask him to fill in for him at his paramount theater performancesthe crooning craze was at its height during this time and the bobby soxer and swooner teenaged girls who were wild about sinatra added como to their list a swooners club voted perry crooner of the year in 1943 the line for a perry como paramount performance was three deep and wound around the city block comos popularity also extended to a more mature audience when he played the versailles and returned to the copacabana where the management placed sroswooning ruled out cards on their tablesdoug storer who was an advertising manager with the blackman company at the time became convinced of comos abilities after hearing him on his unsponsored cbs radio show storer produced a demonstration radio program recording with como and the mitchell ayres orchestra which he brought to the advertising agency that handled the chesterfield cigarettes account initially the agency liked the format of the show but wanted someone else as the star asking storer to obtain the release of the singer they preferred so he would be free for their new program storer decided to do nothing about getting the singer released from his contract when he was contacted by the agency some weeks later saying they were ready to put the program on the air on nbc storer bluntly told them the man for their show was the man they had heard on the demo recording the program was scheduled to make its debut in a week the only option was to hire como for the show storer then arranged for comos release from his cbs contract on december 11 1944 he moved from cbs to nbc for a new radio program chesterfield supper clubthe april 5 1946 broadcasts of the chesterfield supper club took place 20000 feet in the air these were the first known instances of a complete radio show being presented from an airplane como jo stafford the lloyd shaffer orchestra and the entire supper club crew made the flights for the shows two supper club broadcast flights were made that evening at 6 pm and again at 10 pm for the west coast broadcast of the show three flights were made an earlier rehearsal flight was made for reception purposes in addition to the band instruments the plane also carried a small piano because the standheld microphones were not very useful on the plane handheld mikes were used but they became extremely heavy to hold after a few minutes this midair performance caused the american federation of musicians to consider this a new type of engagement and issue a special set of rates for itfrom 1989 until his death in 2001 como cohosted a weekly syndicated radio show with john knox called weekend with perrycomo had not made a nightclub appearance in 26 years when he accepted an engagement at the international hotel in las vegas in june 1970

edition of the vocal group for comos vegas opening como had last appeared at new yorks copacabana in 1944 como continued to do periodic engagements in las vegas and lake tahoe limiting his nightclub appearances to nevadaperforming live again brought como a new sense of enjoyment in may 1974 he embarked on his first concert appearance outside the us a show at the london palladium for the variety club of great britain to aid childrens charities it was here where he discovered what he had been missing when the audience cheered for ten minutes after he walked onstage at the shows end como sat in a chair delightedly chatting back and forth with his equally delighted fans perry returned to the united kingdom in november for a royal variety performance to benefit the entertainment artistes benevolent fund with queen elizabeth the queen mother in attendance como was invited to visit buckingham palace the day after the show at first the invitation did not extend to his associates traveling and working with him and como politely declined when word reached the palace regarding the reason for perrys turning down the invitation it was then extended to include the entire como party and como accepted soon after he announced his first concert tour that began in the uk in the spring of 1975in 1982 como and frank sinatra were invited to entertain italian president sandro pertini at a white house state dinner when he made an official visit president pertini enjoyed their performance enough to join them in singing santa lucia the pair reprised this routine the next year in california as part of the entertainment for queen elizabeths royal visit perry was on the program by special request of the queenin 1984 como traveled the us with his 50th anniversary tour having spent most of his professional life in radio or recording studios and on television soundstages he was enjoying doing live performances even after his 80th birthday como continued the concert tours gone however were the cardigan sweaters which had been a staple of his weekly television shows and which he had actually hated wearing como now performed in a tuxedo saying it shows respect for the audiencethe return to live appearances also provided como with an opportunity to have a little fun with his mister nice guy image in a song ray charles and nick perito his closest collaborator since 1963 wrote and composed for himit doesnt take a guy equipped with espto see whats cookin with your curiosityis mister nice guy just a press agents pitchhis dearest friends say hes a you never thought youd see me in las vegas livei havent played a club since 1885its spelled out in dollar signs you better believe iti can almost read your mindscomo credited bing crosby for influencing his voice and style comos voice is known for its goodnatured vocal acrobatics as portrayed in his novelty songs such as hot diggity dog ziggity boom but there was another side to como music critic gene lees describes it in his sleeve note to comos 1968 album look to your heartdespite his immense popularity como is rarely given credit for what once you stop and think of it he so clearly is one of the great singers and one of the great artists of our timeperhaps the reason people rarely talk about his formidable attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them that celebrated ease of his has been too little understood ease in any art is the result of mastery over the details of the craft you get them together to the point where you can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing como got them together so completely that the muscles dont even show it seems effortless but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album he tries things out in different keys gives the song thought makes suggestions tries it again and again until he is satisfied the hidden work makes him look like mr casual and too many people are taken in by it—but happily so—gene lees sleeve note look to your heartcomos hollywoodtype good looks earned him a sevenyear contract with 20th centuryfox in 1943 he made four films for fox something for the boys 1944 march of time 1945 doll face 1945 and if im lucky 1946 he also appeared in a single film for metrogoldwynmayer words and music 1948 como never appeared to be truly comfortable in films feeling the roles assigned him did not match his personalitya hollywood press agent sought to alter comos life story by changing his previous occupation from barber to coal miner claiming it would make for better press fred othman a hollywood columnist publicly stated that he believed como the barber was just a publicity gimmick como gave him a shave and haircut at the fox studios barber shop to prove him wrong in 1985 como related the story of his first film role experience in something for the boys he sat ready to work in his dressing room for two weeks without being called como spent the next two weeks playing golf still not missed by the studio it was five weeks before he was actually called to the set despite the studios initial urgent report for work notice when como finally appeared the director had no idea who he wasat the time como was signed musical films were on the wane and he became a studio contract player where the actors or actresses worked only when the studio needed to fill out a schedule though his last film words and music was made for prestigious metrogoldwynmayer como fared no better less than two weeks before the films release walter winchell wrote in his syndicated column someone at mgm must have been dozing when they wrote the script for words and music in most of the film perry como is called eddie anders and toward the end for no reason they start calling him perry como como asked for and received a release from the remainder of his mgm contract later the same year quoting como i was wasting their time and they were wasting minecomos comments during a 1949 interview were prophetic as far as his success was concerned at the time he was doing the chesterfield supper club on radio and tv television is going to do me a lot more personal good than the movies ever have the reason should be obvious on television im allowed to be myself in pictures i was always some other guy i come over like just another bum in a tuxedo after he began appearing regularly on television como was offered some film roles that interested him but there was never enough time to pursue any film workcomo made the move to television when nbc initially televised the chesterfield supper club radio program on december 24 1948 a guest on that first show was comos eightyearold son ronnie as part of a boys choir singing silent night with his father the show was the usual friday night chesterfield supper club with an important exception—it was also being broadcast on television the experimental simulcast was to continue for three friday supper club shows but had gone so well nbc decided to extend the televised version through august 1949 years later como admitted to being scared and feeling awkward initially but somehow managed to just be himself said como you cant act on tv with me what you see is what you get while still in its experimental phase como and the television show survived an on location broadcast in durham north carolina on april 15 1949on september 8 1949 it became a weekly halfhour offering on sunday nights directly opposite ed sullivans toast of the town in 1950 como moved to cbs and the shows title was changed to the perry como chesterfield show again sponsored by liggett myers chesterfield cigarettes como hosted this informal 15minute musical variety series on monday wednesday and friday following the cbs television news the faye emerson show was initially broadcast in the same time slot on tuesday and thursday by 1952 it was evident that television would replace radio as the major entertainment medium gary giddins the biographer of bing crosby said in 2001 he como came from this whole generation of crooners—crosby and sinatra but he was the only one of them who figured out tv comos 15minute tv show was simulcast on radio via the mutual broadcasting system beginning august 24 1953 while the chesterfield supper club broadcasts were simulcast on radio and television this was the first instance of a simulcast between two networkscomos cbs contract was to expire on july 1 1955 the year before he had been asked to be the master of ceremonies and narrator of the nbc radio 35th anniversary special that april perry como signed a 12year unbreakable contract with nbc on his last cbs show june 24 1955 como was in high spirits bringing all those who worked off camera on the air for introductions como tried his hand at camera work getting a picture on the air but one that was upsidedown in appreciation for the 11year association his sponsor chesterfield presented him with all the musical arrangements used during this time as a parting gift he moved back to nbc with the perry como show a weekly hourlong variety show featuring additional musical and production numbers comedy sketches and guest stars premiering september 17 1955 this version of his show was also so popular that in the 1956–1957 television season it reached ninth in the nielsen ratings the only show on nbc that season to land in the top tencomos dream along with me became the shows opening theme song mr c received the first of many stacks and stacks of letters requesting him to sing a specific song it was also here where he began wearing his trademark cardigan sweaters the sing to me mr c segment with como seated on a stool singing viewer requested songs had its roots in the first television broadcasts of chesterfield supper club when cameras entered the supper club radio studio they found como and his guests sitting on stools behind music stands the shows closing theme was you are never far away from meperrys announcer on the broadcasts frank gallop became a foil for comos jokes when the television show began there was not enough room for gallop to appear on stage he was an invisible voice from the clouds until the shows 1958–1959 season there was as much fun at rehearsals as on the show itself comos relaxed and funloving manner at rehearsals put many nervous guests at ease it was common for como to leave the saturdayafternoon rehearsal for about a halfhour to go to confession he managed to save some time by asking his music publisher mickey glass to wait in line for him at the confessional glass who was jewish was most agreeable to this but wondered what to do if his turn came before como arrivedcomo thoroughly enjoyed his years working in television saying in a 1989 interview i got a kick out of live television the spontaneity was the fun of it spontaneity and the ability to be himself came in handy for swimmeractress esther williamss guest appearance of march 16 1957 a wardrobe malfunction meant that viewers were seeing more of esther than 1950s television considered to be in good taste more live show mishaps followed at the shows end williams was swimming in a pool specially constructed on the set for her appearance como simply said goodnight folks and leaped fully clothed into the swimming poolon december 17 1955 viewers were able to see firsthand what como did for a living before he was a professional singer actor kirk douglas was one of comos television guests douglas had grown a beard for his vincent van gogh role in lust for life which finished filming that week como shaved douglass beard live on national television on september 15 1956 the season premiere of the perry como show was broadcast from nbcs new color television studio at the new york ziegfeld theatre making it one of the first weekly color tv shows in addition to this season premiere as a color television show there was also a royal visit from prince rainier of monaco and his bride of six months grace kelly como competed with jackie gleason in what was billed as the battle of the giants and won this is rarely mentioned in part because como commonly downplayed his achievements and because the two men were friends the weekly ratings winner would phone the loser for some mock gloating at the height of this television competition como asked gleason a favor to visit his home when his motherinlaw a big gleason fan was there though mrs belline spoke no english and gleason no italian roselles mother was thrilled comos words to gleason after the visit anything you want you got it in fact ill even do one of your shows so the ratings will be better como was among those who filled in for gleason on the jackie gleason show in 1954 when the entertainer suffered a broken ankle and leg in an onair fallan example of comos popularity came in 1956 when life conducted a poll of young women asking them which man in public life most fit the concept of their ideal husband it was perry como a 1958 nationwide poll of us teenagers found como to be the most popular male singer beating elvis presley who was the winner of the previous years poll at one point his television show was broadcast in at least 12 other countriesanother way to judge the value of the como show to the network can be found in the following during sound checks at rehearsals it was often difficult to hear comos soft voice without having a large microphone ruin a camera shot nbc had rca design a microphone for the show—the rca type bk10a—which was known as the como mic it was able to pick up comos voice properly and was small enough not to interfere with camera shotsin 1959 como signed a 25 million deal with kraft foods and moved to wednesday nights hosting perry comos kraft music hall weekly for the next four years over the next four seasons from 1963 to 1967 the series was presented as monthly specials alternating with kraft suspense theatre the andy williams show and finally the road west como became the highestpaid performer in the history of television to that date earning mention in the guinness book of world records como himself took part in none of this his production company roncom named for son ronald como handled the transaction along with all other como business matters como also had control of the show which would replace his during the summer television hiatus while mr c was having a holiday viewers would see perry presents beginning in 1959in late 1962 after the cuban missile crisis had settled well enough to permit the evacuated servicemens families to return to guantanamo bay naval base in cuba secretary of defense robert mcnamara was eager to do more for morale there he asked como to bring his television show to the naval base como and his cast and crew were at guantanamo when the families of the armed forces began their return the first entertainers to visit the base since the crisis the como show filmed there for eight days some highlights of the program which was seen in the us on december 12 1962 included comos shaving a serviceman with a castrolike beard and the enthusiastic participation when perry asked for volunteers to come on stage to do the twist with the lovely ladies who were part of the visiting dance troupefilming for the

sang with them the choir performed a christmas hymn in latin written by their director domenico bartolucci called christ is born as part of their presentation como asked his associate ray charles to write english lyrics for the song using it many times on both television shows and his christmas albums the carpenters also recorded the song on their first christmas album christmas portraitbeginning in 1967 como began reducing his tv appearances gradually becoming limited to seasonal and holiday specials with the emphasis being on christmas a large part of comos public persona was the idea that he personally knew santa claus como had numerous christmas television specials beginning on christmas eve 1948 and continuing to 1994 when his final christmas special was recorded in ireland they were recorded in many countries including israel mexico and canada as well as many locations throughout the united states including a colonial america christmas in williamsburg virginia the 1987 christmas special was cancelled at the behest of an angry como the american broadcasting company abc was willing to offer him only a saturday 10 pm time slot for it three weeks before the holiday como filled the yearly gap for his fans with live christmas concerts in various locationscomos final christmas special was filmed in january 1994 in dublins point theatre before an audience of 4500 including irish president mary robinson and comos friend the actress maureen ohara perry comos irish christmas was a public broadcasting service pbs production made by an irish independent production company in association with rté como appearing aged and unwell had the flu during the show which took four hours to record at the shows conclusion como apologized to his dublin audience for a performance he felt was not up to his usual standards during his visit to dublin como visited a barber shop called the como on thomas street the owners lifelong fans who named their business in his honor had sent photographs of the shop and letters to como inviting him to visit photos of como with the barbers were framed in the shop the como closed in 2002 but it remains a household name in the libertiesin 1929 the 17yearold como met roselle belline at a picnic on chartiers creek that attracted many young people from the canonsburg area como who attended the cookout with another girl did not spot roselle until everyone was around the campfire singing and the gathering was coming to a close when it came comos turn to sing he chose more than you know with his eyes on roselle for the entire song they were married july 31 1933 they raised three children ronnie david and terri because como believed his professional life and his personal life should be kept separate he declined repeated interview requests from edward r murrows person to personin 1946 como moved to flower hill new yorkin 1958 the comos celebrated their silver wedding anniversary with a family trip to italy on the itinerary was an audience with pope pius xii como who sat in a side wing of the long island church where he attended sunday mass in an effort to avoid attracting attention was both puzzled and upset on returning home that photos from the visit made the newspapers throughout the world a thorough check of the como and nbc publicity offices found neither was responsible the photos had been released by the vaticans press department when perry and roselle became knight commander and lady commander of the equestrian order of the holy sepulchre in 1952 it was a news item only after archbishop fulton j sheen who had been honored at the same ceremony mentioned it some time laterin 1971 while taping perry comos winter show in hollywood como suffered a debilitating fall from a stage platform xrays showed no serious injury to his knee but by the next morning it was swollen to twice its normal size como chartered a jet to his home and doctors in florida where a second exam showed the knee was seriously broken his knee was reset and placed in a cast recuperation took eight months in 1993 he was successfully treated for bladder cancer after 65 years of marriage roselle died august 12 1998 at age 84 como was devastated by her deathone of the many factors in his success was comos insistence on his principles of good taste if he considered something to be in bad or questionable taste it was not in the show or broadcast when a line written for julius la rosa about television personality arthur godfrey on the perry como show was misconstrued como offered an onair apology at the beginning of his next show against the advice of his staff while his performance of ave maria was a tradition of his holiday television programs como refused to sing it at live performances saying its not the time or place to do it even though it was the numberone request of his audiencesanother factor was his naturalness the man on tv every week was the same person who could be encountered behind a supermarket shopping cart at a bowling alley or in a kitchen making breakfast from his first chesterfield supper club tv show if scripts were written at all they were based on comos everyday manner of speaking though como was widely known for his amiability laidback and easygoing style he was not devoid of a temper and it could be seen at times as a result of the frustrations of daily life mitchell ayres his musical director from 1948 1963 said perry has a temper like everyone else and he loses his temper at the normal things everyone else does when were driving for instance and somebody cuts him off he really lets the offender have itbing crosby once described como as the man who invented casual his preference for casual clothing did not keep him from being named one of the best dressed
