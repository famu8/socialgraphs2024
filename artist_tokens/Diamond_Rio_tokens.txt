the band is known for its vocal harmonies varied instrumentation and nearexclusive use of only its own band members on recordings instead of session musicians their sound was originally defined by mainstream country bluegrass and rock influences but later albums drew more influence from christian country music and country popin 1982 matt davenport and danny gregg founded a band at opryland usa a former country musicbased amusement park in nashville tennessee the band was first named the grizzly river boys after a new river rafting ride at the park but quickly changed names to the tennessee river boys due to its members disliking the original name originally intended to promote the park through a onetime television special the band proved popular enough that it became one of many regular performers there davenport gregg and ty herndon alternated as lead vocalists with davenport also playing bass guitar and gregg on rhythm guitar completing the lineup were larry beard lead guitar fiddle banjo mel deal steel guitar al deleonibus piano and ed mummert drums the group swapped lead voices told jokes and balanced oldschool country concert shtick with a contemporary sound herndon left the group in 1983 to compete on the talent show star search and became a solo artist for epic records between 1995 and the early 2000s herndon was temporarily replaced by anthony crawford and then virgil true before his role was taken over by marty roe who had originally toured nationally with the christian band windsong and worked in the park by doing impersonations of larry gatlin following herndons departure delonibus and mummert quit as well with dan truman who had previously played in brigham young universitys young ambassadors and jimmy j j whiteside taking their places beard quit shortly afterward and ultimately became a session musician and former mel mcdaniel sideman jimmy olander took his place the band through the assistance of bill andersons drummer len snuffy miller submitted demos to various nashville record labels with no successby 1985 the tennessee river boys had quit working at opryland according to roe while the band enjoyed playing at the park they also felt that their status as a theme park attraction discredited them as real musicians to those in the nashville community for the next few years they played at small venues such as high school auditoriums and usually worked no more than four concerts a month they also competed on star search but were eliminated in the first round frustrated by the sporadic touring schedules whiteside quit the group and was replaced by brian prout who previously performed in hot walker band and heartbreak mountain around 1986 deal and gregg both left the group the latter due to health complications from a serious illness he had developed as a teenager they initially chose to operate as a quintet with davenport as the sole lead vocalist and roe and prout singing harmony when this arrangement proved unsuccessful they found mandolinist gene johnson a former member of the bluegrass group eddie adcocks iind generation which olander was a fan of as a child johnson debuted at a concert in clewiston florida in may 1987 also at this point the band members supplemented their incomes with outside jobs johnson continued to work in carpentry olander and roe mowed lawns and prout drove tour busesin 1988 the band caught the attention of keith stegall a singersongwriter who would later become known primarily for his work as alan jacksons record producer stegall produced demos for the tennessee river boys but noted that davenport could not record the lead vocal and bass parts at the same time as they would be difficult to separate in the control room as a result stegall had roe sing a scratch vocal track live with the other musicians which would then be replaced by davenports voice in postproduction upon hearing roe sing the scratch track stegall successfully convinced the other members that roe should be the lead vocalist instead due to his discomfort outside the lead role and his wifes dissatisfaction with his career davenport quit in late 1988 becoming the last founding member to leave the group quickly had to find a replacement as they were scheduled to appear on the talk show nashville now on january 23 1989 alan lebeouf who had just left baillie the boys expressed interest in replacing davenport but ultimately declined due to other commitments they finally chose dana williams a nephew of the bluegrass group osborne brothers and former sideman for jimmy c newman who had been a fan of the tennessee river boys since herndon was a memberwilliams officially joined before the nashville now appearance but the band still did not have a record deal at this point they continued to record demos in prouts garage with assistance from monty powell who had previously hired roe and olander for recording jingles but wanted to produce commercial music powell was a friend of audio engineer mike clute who would later become one of the bands producers and songwriters tim dubois and van stephenson dubois was talking with record executive clive davis about creating a country music branch of arista records called arista nashville stephenson would later sign to the label in 1993 as a member of blackhawk initially dubois was hesitant about signing the tennessee river boys as he felt that there were too many popular bands in country music and he was about to sign both asleep at the wheel and exile he expressed interest in signing roe as a solo artist but at powells insistence he agreed to see the band open for george jones at a may 1989 concert and officially signed them to arista nashville in 1990 the band members also decided to choose a new name as they thought that tennessee river boys sounded more suitable for a bluegrass or gospel group than a country one among the names they had chosen were kilroy and ttown mavericks the latter of which was rejected by arista executives prout suggested diamond rio after the truck manufacturing company diamond reo trucks the name had been previously rejected by another country band shenandoah whose lead singer marty raybon also a former member of heartbreak mountain gave prout permission to use the name even though shenandoah conducted business under that nameshortly after the band received its record deal the band underwent a series of misfortunes when olander johnson and williams came down with health problems on august 9 1990 johnson was injured in a carpentry accident in arkansas a day before his 41st birthday severely cutting his left thumb robert bolin substituted for johnson during the bands tour in brazil with kevin welch and jann browne on september 6 four weeks after johnsons accident williams was water skiing with his family in cookeville tennessee as his boat came forward at high speed when his wife was picking him up the propeller slashed williams legs and he was rushed to a hospital for his injuries brian helgos and paul gregg danny greggs brother and a member of restless heart substituted for williams meanwhile olander discovered that he had a lemonsized tumor that was pressing against his esophagus the tumor was never successfully diagnosed although it ultimately vanishedafter olander williams and johnson had recovered the six musicians set to work on their debut album in doing so johnson soon discovered that the injuries to his hands had altered his dexterity on the mandolin and threatened to walk away after powell offhandedly remarked that he would have roe dub in his own tenor harmonies instead of having johnson sing them the band also had commitments to finish as the tennessee river boys to the point that they occasionally had to promote themselves under both names in the same dayarista nashville released diamond rios debut single meet in the middle on february 6 1991 as the lead single to their selftitled debut album meet in the middle went on to spend two weeks at no 1 on the billboard hot country songs charts making diamond rio the first country music group ever to send its debut single to the top of that chart following its release the band performed its first official concert as diamond rio on may 4 1991 they shared the bill with wild rose whose membership included prouts thenwife nancy given prout released three weeks later with dubois and powell as producers diamond rio was met with positive critical reception from critics such as allmusic chicago tribune and entertainment weekly which praised the bands vocal harmonies instrumentation and song choicesfour more singles were released from diamond rio all reaching top 10 on the billboard country singles charts mirror mirror mama dont forget to pray for me norma jean riley which was previously the bside of mama dont forget to pray for me and nowhere bound the latter two of which were cowritten by powell roe and prout had found both mama dont forget to pray for me and mirror mirror by attending shows at the bluebird cafe in nashville a popular spot for performances by aspiring songwriters truman and an employee of arista had found norma jean riley which was originally titled pretty little lady until dubois remarked that the lady in the song should have a name it could be norma jean riley anything johnson spoke positively about mama dont forget to pray for me which was written and originally recorded by larry cordle and the impact that it had on fans he recalled a letter sent to him by a female fan who had run away from home and chose to return after hearing that song and said that we already didnt wan na do the drinkin songs and stuff if youre gon na touch someone touch them with something thats positivediamond rio was later certified platinum by the recording industry association of america riaa for shipping one million copies in the united states in addition the band won the academy of country musics top vocal group for 1992 an award they would receive again in 1993 1994 and 1997 they were also nominated for top new vocal duet or group by the same association in 1992 a cut from the album the instrumental poultry promenade gave the band its first grammy award nominationclose to the edge the groups second album was released in 1992 certified gold by the riaa for us shipments of 500000 copies the album produced the top 5 country hits in a week or two and oh me oh my sweet baby the latter of which was originally recorded by george strait on his 1989 album beyond the blue neon the next singles this romeo aint got julie yet and sawmill road both failed to reach top 10 roe considered close to the edge a weaker album than their debut because the band only had one month to pick the songs for it in a 1994 interview with new country magazine he stated there arent ten great songs out there for everybody certainly not that you could find in a 30day period of time olander was also critical of the novelty factor of this romeo aint got julie yet which he cowrote saying that it was by far not my favorite diamond rio recording – but thats at the time when im thinkin oh this is easy lets write this its kinda cute brian mansfield of allmusic was also critical of the song but described the rest of the album with favor saying that its strongest material emphasizes the virtues of god family and honest living – traditional stuff no doubt influenced by the members bluegrass background while jack hurst of the chicago tribune thought that in a week or two and sawmill road which is about the diverse trails some rural schoolmates follow in adulthood were the strongest tracksin 1994 the band released its third album love a little stronger the album was recorded on a more relaxed schedule than the previous album as a result they did not have a single on the charts for three months after sawmill road fell off the charts for this album clute joined dubois and powell as coproducer a role that he has held on all of the bands subsequent releases the title track cowritten by billy crittenden later a member of the vocal group 4 runner reached a peak of no 2 on the billboard country singles charts and no 1 on the country singles chart published by radio records it was followed by the no 9 hit night is fallin in my heart originally recorded by j p pennington in 1991 next were the top 20 hits bubba hyde and finish what we started because the band had taken a longer period of time to choose songs for love a little stronger they considered it a superior album to its predecessor mansfield shared a similar opinion in his review of the album stating that spurred by the relatively lackluster performance of close to the edge diamond rio explored the musical possibilities of its talents rather than digging for easy commercial success bob cannon of new country was more mixed saying that the production on love a little stronger is so sparkling clean it couldve been recorded in an operating room this album also earned the band its second platinum certificationiv diamond rios fourth album was released in 1996 it was the first country release recorded entirely on a digital console specifically a fairlight console which recorded the album directly to a hard drive produced by dubois clute and the band itself it was also their first album not to have powell as a coproducer according to dubois powell left this role on good terms as he saw a need to go in a certain direction and the guys saw a need to go in a different direction roe thought that the album benefited from a new label policy that allowed label personnel to respond more quickly to pitches from songwriters he recalled to billboard that the labels head of artists and repertoire ar recommended the lead single walkin away while cowriter craig wiseman who cowrote bubba hyde was still recording its demo and the band was able to record the song in the same day that the demo was completed walkin away peaked at no 2 on the country charts in early 1996 three more singles were released from the album the top 10 hits thats what i get for lovin you and holdin also written by wiseman with the top 20 its all in your head cowritten by van stephenson in between the music video for its all in your head featured martin sheen and ramon estevez the former playing the part of a snake handling preachera year after iv diamond rio released its first greatest hits package which included eleven of the singles from their first four albums plus the album cut she misses him on sunday the most from iv and two new songs how your love makes me feel and imagine that how your love makes me feel became the bands second no 1 on hot country songs as well as their longestlasting at three weeks making it the biggest chart hit for any country group that year imagine that cowritten by bryan white reached top 5 by early 1998 greatest hits became the bands third platinum albumdiamond rio was inducted into the grand ole opry in april 1998 becoming the first band in fourteen years to be inducted later in the year the band released its fifth studio album unbelievable contributing songwriters to the album included paul williams former nrbq member al anderson robert john mutt lange and huey lewis the lead single was the ballad youre gone which reached top 5 on the country charts after it was the title track which peaked at no 2 on the country charts and became the bands first entry on the billboard hot 100 where it reached no 36 the third and final single was i know how the river feels originally recorded on herndons 1996 album living in a moment and later released as a single by mcalyster in 2000 diamond rios rendition peaked at 33 on the country charts their lowest chart peak at the timein 1998 prout began dating mary bono the widow of singer and politician sonny bono the two became engaged but later ended their relationship in 2001 on december 28 of the same year prout married singersongwriter stephanie bentley best known for cowriting faith hills 1999 single breathediamond rio released its twentythird official chart single stuff in may 2000 the song was originally intended to be the title track to their sixth studio album which would have been released on august 22 of the same year but according to truman certain radio stations for some reason didnt want to play stuff as a result stuff was withdrawn after peaking at number 36 on the country charts and the album was delayed until february 2001 following this songs failure the band released one more day later in 2000 the song was written by steven dale jones and bobby tomberlin the same two writers who wrote she misses him on sunday the most one more day went on to spend two nonconsecutive weeks at no 1 on the country charts with the album by this point retitled one more day having its release date moved up to february 6 2001 the song also peaked at no 29 on the billboard hot 100 in addition to reaching top 10 on the adult contemporary charts the bands first appearance on that chart regarding the songs popularity among fans who have used the song to cope with personal losses prout said actually one more day was recorded as a love song then one of oklahoma states basketball teams plane went down then in early 2001 we lost dale in daytona and then of course 911 came after that and every event of that year the song took on a different meaning to different people we hear quite often in emails and people talking to us in shows if youre asking how it makes us feel pretty darn special to know that you had that impact on someones life and helped in a tough time of healing and hopethe third and fourth singles from one more day were less successful sweet summer made top 20 while thats just that failed to make top 40 the album featured a guest vocal from chely wright on im trying making for the bands first ever duet with another artist on one of their own albums it also included a cover of hearts against the wind originally recorded by jd souther and linda ronstadt for the urban cowboy soundtrack chris neal of country weekly thought that the album showed a greater musical variety than its predecessors specifically noting the spokenword verses of here i go fallin the hearts against the wind cover and the wright duet as standout tracks rick cohoon of allmusic cited the albums singles and the wright duet as the albums best tracks adding that if any flaw can be found here it would be the bands choice not to experiment with new sound but then again why tamper with a good thingstarting in 2001 the other members had noticed that roe was having difficulty maintaining proper pitch in concert although they did not want to confront him about it for fear of bruis his ego they eventually convinced roe of his problems by listening to concert recordings together roe also consulted unsuccessfully with vocal coaches and throat doctors at the vanderbilt university medical center the band attempted to cover up roes problems by removing certain songs from concert set lists lowering the key on others having truman sometimes take the lead vocal and using pitch correction software but even these did not fully correct the issues finally they consulted vocal coach diane sheets a friend of johnsons soninlaw she determined that roe was overcompensating for a small degree of hearing loss typical of musicians who have performed live for long periods of time thus tightening muscles in his throat and diaphragm and causing him to lose pitch although roe was initially cynical toward sheetss coaching she was ultimately successful in restoring his voicein 2002 diamond rio released its seventh studio album completely the band originally conceived it as a double album featuring traditional country on one disc and more poporiented country on the other but according to prout this concept did not fully materialize because country music has blinders on as far as whats acceptable – and what isnt although olander and williams noted that the idea allowed them more leeway in choosing songs in addition to earning a gold certification it produced two consecutive no 1 singles in beautiful mess and i believe the latter being the bands last single to top hot country songs third single wrinkles made top 20 while the last single we all fall down also written by steven dale jones failed to reach top 40 two of the albums tracks were previously recorded by other artists make sure youve got it all written by bill anderson and steve wariner was originally recorded on collin rayes 1998 album the walls came down and if youd like some lovin by its cowriter david ball on his 1996 album starlite loungerick cohoon of allmusic praised the album for its musical variety saying with artists as well anchored in the business as diamond rio the musical quality is a given the real challenge is outdoing yourself and coming up with fresh concepts the selections on this album seem to be the fruition of that search for musical renewal he cited beautiful mess and i believe as standout tracks ray waddell of billboard also thought that the singles were among the best tracks on the album while highlighting the instrumental track rural philharmonic which olander had originally intended to record for a solo album as an example of the bands strong musicianship chrissie dickinson of the chicago tribune was less favorable commending the masterful musicianship and roes light vocal timbre while criticizing the song selections as mostly a paintbynumbers trip around the musical block from the predictable power balladry of i believe to the saccharine sentiments of we all fall downa seventh album tentatively titled cant you tell was recorded in 2003 but it was cancelled after its first two singles – the title track and one believer – both failed to make top 40 upon their releases in late 2004 and early 2005 respectively diamond rios second greatest hits package greatest hits ii was released in 2006 like their first greatest hits album this compilation included several new songs as well as the bands greatest hits one of these new songs god only cries was released as a single peaking at no 30 shortly after the albums release diamond rio parted ways with arista nashvilleon august 31 2007 diamond rio signed with word records a christian music label based in nashville their first album for word was a christmas album entitled a diamond rio christmas the star still shines which they recorded in olanders basement studio roe said in an interview with cmt that we just didnt try to copy anybody else we tried to make up our own arrangements the group released its first contemporary christian album the reason on september 22 2009 it earned the band three dove award nominations song of the year for god is there country song of the year for the title track and country album of the yearin 2014 olander told the arizona republic that the group was no longer signed to word records and planned to release new material independently i will say that i was proud of the material but maybe its not the best version of diamond rio olander told the publication we were kind of in a nomans land we didnt fit in with country radio and we didnt fit with christian radio it was something that wasnt fully realized the band began releasing records independently starting with a live album in 2014 and following in 2015 with the studio album i made itprout and johnson both retired from the band in 2022 micah schweinsberg filled in on drums and carson mckee on harmony vocals mandolin and

members of the band in mid2023 making mckee the bands first female member the first single following their addition to the lineup an instrumental called the kick was released soon afterdiamond rio has been featured on several projects featuring multiple country artists including three tribute albums released between 1993 and 1994 the first was a cover of the eagles 1975 hit lyin eyes for common thread the songs of the eagles an album released in late 1993 via giant records which featured various country musicians covering that bands songs diamond rio had originally wanted to record the song for love a little stronger but dubois rejected the idea because he felt that they were not yet wellestablished enough to record a cover song on one of their own albums the second was keith whitley a tribute album to which they contributed a cover of keith whitleys 1986 hit ten feet away and the third was a cover of merle haggards workin man blues for a tribute album entitled mamas hungry eyes a

christ of latterday saints of which truman is a member roe johnson and williams sang backing vocals on josh turners 2006 single me and god from the album your man which also featured a guest vocal from bluegrass musician ralph stanleyin the country music industry particularly record producers hire mostly session musicians to record instrumental tracks for an album for both solo artists and bands as opposed to rock bands who record their own instrumental and vocal tracks on their albums diamond rio has been one of few selfcontained country bands to have followed the practice of each member playing their own instruments and singing their own vocals on all their albums themselves without any additional input from outside musicians the sole exception has been the inclusion of string sections on some of their later work starting with i know how the river feels and continuing through certain tracks on one more day and completely according to prout other labels had rejected the band prior to their signing with arista nashville due to the band members insistence that they play all their own instrumentstheir early music blended neotraditionalist country with occasional traces of country rock primarily in the songs prominent rhythm sections a bluegrass influence has also been shown primarily in the threepart harmonies among roe lead williams baritone and johnson tenor bluegrass influences are also shown in the bands prominent use of the mandolin as well as in the instrumentals featured on many of their earlier albums the bands later material has tended towards poporiented ballads such as i believe and one more day – songs which received critical acclaim for their often religiousthemed messages but were considered departures from the more traditional material of their first four albumsanother trademark of diamond rios sound is the custombuilt bbender guitar played by olander he refers to this instrument as the taxicaster because of its yellow body and blackandwhite checkered pickguard which give it the coloration of a taxicabdiamond rio received the academy of country musics award for top vocal group in 1991 and 1992 in 1992 1993 1994 and 1997
