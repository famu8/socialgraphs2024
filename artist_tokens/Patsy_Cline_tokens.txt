on her recording contract her first recording session took place in nashville tennessee on january 5 1955 songs for the session were handpicked by mccall and paul cohen four star leased the recordings

the rough guide commented that the music was sturdy enough but they only hinted at the potential that lurked inside her richie unterberger of allmusic claimed it was clines voice that made the four star material less appealing circumstances were not wholly to blame for clines commercial failures she would have never made it as a rockabilly singer lacking the conviction of wanda jackson or the spunk of brenda lee in fact in comparison with her best work she sounds rather stiff and illatease on most of her early singlesbetween 1955 and 1956 clines four singles for four star failed to become hits however she continued performing regionally including on the town and country jamboree in 1956 she appeared on abcs country music jubilee ozark jubilee it was at one of her local performances

public demand decca records rushreleased the song as a single on february 11 the song ultimately became clines breakthrough hit peaking at number 2 on the billboard hot country and western sides chart the song also reached number 12 on the billboard pop music chart the song has since been considered a classic in country music since its releasemusic critics and writers have positively praised walkin after midnight mary bufwack and robert oermann called the song bluesy richie unterberger noted its wellsuited for the almost bemused aura of loneliness of the lyric the success of walkin after

the television program western ranch party in march the money she had earned from her numerous engagements totaled out to ten thousand dollars cline gave all the money to her mother which she used to the pay the mortgage on her winchester house in august 1957 her debut studio album was released on decca recordsclines followup singles to walkin after midnight did not yield any success this was

hoss cant you do something i feel like a prisoner around the same time cline was fired from her regular slot on town and country jamboree according to connie b gay she ran late for shows and showed up

was going to perform it differently nelsons version included a spoken section that cline removed she cut additional material on august 17 and when she got to crazy it became difficult to perform

production have received high praise over time cub koda of allmusic noted the ache in her voice that makes the song stand out clines reading of the lyric is filled with an aching world weariness that transforms the tune into one of the first big crossover hits without even trying hard country music historian paul kingsbury also highlighted her ache saying in 2007 clines hit recording swings with such velvety finesse and her voice throbs and aches so exquisitely that the entire production sounds absolutely effortless jhoni jackson of paste magazine called the recording iconic highlighting the emotional pain cline expressed in her voicecrazy and clines further decca recordings have received critical praise mary bufwack and robert oermann noted her thrilling voice invariably invested these with new depth patsys dramatic volume control stretchednote effects sobs pauses and unique ways of holding back then bursting into fullthroated phrases also breathed new life into country chestnuts

originally meryl streep auditioned for clines role but ultimately lost to lange the film was produced by bernard schwartz who also produced coal miners daughter original ideas called for scenes between cline and lynn however they were ultimately removed from the final script the film has been criticized for its lack of accuracy to clines own life and its musical production kurt wolff wrote the soundtrack however featured overdubbed versions of clines material – better to stick with the originals mark deming of allmovie only gave the release two out of five stars deming commented while its a wise approach to show how her turbulent marriage paralleled her crossover to countrypolitan ballads the melodrama tends to overshadow the celebrity story by relegating her rise to stardom to the background due to the historically dubious concerts at carnivals and fairgrounds it appears as though she wasnt as big a star as she actually was deming did praise langes performance saying she created a cheerful and spirited depiction of cline roger ebert gave it two stars in his original 1985 review ebert said there isnt the sense of a wellshaped structure in this movie theres no clear

recreated in the theater sector in 1988 the show alwayspatsy cline premiered the show was created by ted swindley who derived it from a friendship cline had with texas resident louise seger the pair met while cline was performing at the esquire ballroom in houston texas seger brought cline home following the show and they spent the night together the pair would remain in contact through letters before clines death much of the script relied from letters exchanged between the two during the course of several years seger acts as the shows narrator and revisits memories she shared with cline through their letter exchanges among the shows original performers was mandy barnett who debuted the show at the ryman auditorium in 1994 barnett would go on to have a music and performing career a second musical was later released in 1991 titled a closer walk with patsy cline the show was written by dean regan and has been called a musical retelling of clines careercline was influenced by various music artists among her earliest influences were pop singers of the 1940s and 1950s these included kay starr helen morgan patti page and kate smith patti page recollected that clines husband said to her i just wish patsy could have met you because she just adored you and listened to you all the time and wanted to be like you among her primary influences was kay starr of whom cline was a fervent devotee according to the washington post jack hurst of the chicago tribune remarked that her rich powerful voice obviously influenced by that of pops kay starr has continued and perhaps even grown in popularity over the decades cline was also attracted to country music radio programs notably the grand ole opry according to mary bufwack and robert oermann cline became obsessed with the program at a young age clines mother hilda hensley commented on her daughters admiration i know she never wanted anything so badly as to be a star on the grand ole opry among performers from the program she admired was patsy montana cline was also influenced by other types of performers including early rockabilly artist charline arthurcline possessed a contralto voice time magazine writer richard corliss called her voice bold her voice has also been praised for its display of emotion kurt wolff called it one of the most emotionally expressive voices in modern country music tony gabrielle of the daily press wrote that cline had a voice of tremendous emotional power cline was at times taken by her own emotion husband charlie dick recounted that clines producer owen bradley told him to leave a recording session because she was very emotional and he didnt want to disturb the mood cline was once quoted in describing the emotion she felt saying oh lord i sing just like i hurt insideduring her early career cline recorded in styles such as gospel rockabilly and honkytonk these styles she cut for four star records have been considered below the quality of her later work for decca records steve leggett of allmusic commented her recordings prior to 1960 though were something else again and with the exception of 1956s walkin after midnight and perhaps one or two other songs she seemed reined in and stifled as a singer even though she was working with the same producer owen bradley who was to produce her 1960s successes oh the difference a song makes because in the end the material she recorded between 1955 and 1960 – all of which is collected on these two discs – was simply too weak for cline to turn into anything resembling gold even with her obvious vocal skillsclines style has been largely associated with the nashville sound a subgenre of country music that linked traditional lyrics with orchestrated pop music styles this new sound helped many of her singles to crossover onto the billboard hot 100 and gain a larger audience that did not always listen to country music her producer owen bradley built this sound onto her decca recordings sensing a potential in her voice that went beyond traditional country music at first she resisted the popsounding style but was ultimately convinced to record in this new style stephen m desuner of pitchfork explained that cline has been an identifiable factor with the nashville sound she essentially rewrote their songs simply by singing them elevating their words and wringing every one of their rhymes for maximum dramatic potential mark deming of allmusic commented cline and bradley didnt invent countrypolitan but precious few artists managed to meld the sophistication of pop and the emotional honesty of country as brilliantly as this music accomplishes with seemingly effortless grace and these songs still sound fresh and brilliantly crafted decades after the factclines public image changed during the course of her career she began her career wearing cowgirl dresses and hats designed by her mother however as her music crossed over into pop she began wearing sequined gowns and cocktail dresses while she would often wear cowgirl costumes for live performances she would also wear evening dresses for television and metropolitan performances for her 1957 performance on arthur godfreys talent scouts the shows producer insisted that cline wear an evening dress instead of the fringed cowgirl attire she had intended to wear her 1962 engagement at the merrimint theatre in las vegas represented this particular image shift for one of her performances cline wore a sequined cocktail dress designed by her mothercline has also been seen as a pioneer for women in country music she has been cited as an inspiration by many performers in diverse styles of music kurt wolff of country music the rough guide said that cline had an aggression and boisterous attitude that gained her the respect of her male counterparts wolff explained she swaggered her way past stereotypes and other forces of resistance showing the men in charge – and the public in general – that women were more than capable of singing about such hard subjects as divorce and drinking as well as love and understanding sean ohagan of the guardian commented that along with minnie pearl jean shepard and kitty wells cline helped prove that country music was not macho and that strong women could have a strong voice in 2013 diane reese wrote she was what i call a prefeminist woman she didnt open doors she kicked them down mary bufwack and robert k oermann wrote in 2003 that cline transformed what it meant to be a female country starcline has been cited in both country and pop music as of one of the greatest vocalists of all time her voice has also been called haunting powerful and emotional clines emotional expression and delivery of lyrics helped influence various musical genres and artists with the support of producer owen bradley cline has been said to help define the nashville sound style of country music while the subgenre has received mixed opinions it has also been said to be a significant part of country musics authenticity with cline being the center focal point of the subgenre other artists have noted her impact including leann rimes who stated i remember my dad telling me to listen to the way she told a story i remember feeling more emotion when she sang than anyone else i had ever heard lucinda williams commented on clines vocal talent in helping define her legacy stating even though her style is considered country her delivery is more like a classic pop singer thats what set her apart from loretta lynn or tammy wynette youd almost think she was classically trainedcline has been a major influence on various music artists including reba mcentire loretta lynn leann rimes kd lang linda ronstadt trisha yearwood sara evans dottie west kacey musgraves margo price cyndi lauper trixie mattel and brandi carlile dottie west also a close friend of clines spoke about her influence on her own career i think i was most influenced by patsy cline she said things for people there was so much feeling in there in fact she told me hoss if you cant do it with feeling dont in 2019 sara evans discussed how cline has been an influence since she was a young girl i learned everything i could learn about her i tried to mimic her singing to the t we grew up singing in bars — my brothers sisters and i — from the time i was really little so i started covering every patsy cline song then
