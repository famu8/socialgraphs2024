singing for his supper he worked in mines and rode in boxcars and in the coldest part of winter he welcomed vagrancy arrests for the warm place to sleep at his last stop in timmins ontario he found himself a nickel short of a 35cent beer at the citys maple leaf hotel connors told the bartender to put the cap back on the bottle and hed head for the sally ann but the bartender gaëtan lepine accepted the 30 cents and offered him a second beer if he would open his guitar case and play a few songs these few songs turned into a 14month run at the hotel a weekly spot on ckgb in timmins eight 45rpm recordings and the end of the beginning for tom connorsconnors was never part of the canadian musical establishment and his style was quite different from other canadian icons such as leonard cohen or gordon lightfoot he could however be characterized as a passionist poet within canadian culture similar to milton acorn and stan rogers as the national post characterized himhe sang of a nation without politics to its proud history and to its better angels his songs remind us that canada matters—that weve built something amazing here and must not take it for grantedtypically writing about canadian lore and history some of connors betterknown songs include bud the spud big joe mufferaw the black donnellys the martin hartwell story reesor crossing tragedy sudbury saturday night and the hockey song this last often incorrectly called the good old hockey game is frequently played over sound systems at national hockey league nhl gamesthroughout the years connors never lost touch with gaëtan lepine the bartender he befriended in timmins in fact the two wrote many songs together these songs are featured in 250 songs by stompin tom including all the words and chordsin 1968 he composed and sang a radio jingle for a sudburyarea tire store duhamel dewar in exchange for a set of winter tireswhen your tires are old and wornand you think they should be newerdrive on down to the tire townand see duhamel and dewarduring the mid1970s connors wrote and recorded the consumer an ode to billpaying that became the theme song for the popular canadian broadcasting corporation cbc consumer affairs program marketplace for the first few seasons connors appeared in the programs opening credits before the consumer was replaced as the theme—initially by an instrumental background version and ultimately by a different piece of musicin 1974 connors had a series running on cbc television in which he met and exchanged with folks from all across canada stompin toms canada was coproduced with the cbc and consisted of 26 halfhour episodesthe song that connors wrote in the least time was maritime waltz which was completed in 12 minuteshis character was rough but genuine as the national post notedhat persona wasnt shtick stompin tom was one of the great canadian storytellers and a uniquely collegial one as well the proper venue for a gordon lightfoot performance is a concert hall where the audience connects silently and contemplatively the proper venue for mr connors was a smoky bar room where people connected by slamming their beer mugs together hopefully obliterating whatever differences existed between themin 1999 after completing a 38city tour connors received the national achievement award at the annual socan awards held in torontoin 2009 connors was the recipient of the prestigious lifetime achievement award at the annual socan awards in torontoconnors habit of stomping the heel of his left boot to keep rhythm earned him the nickname that stompin guy or stomper it wasnt until canadas 100th birthday july 1 1967 that the name stompin tom connors was first used when boyd macdonald a waiter at the king george tavern in peterborough ontario introduced connors on stage based on an enthused audience reaction to it connors had it officially registered in ontario as stompin tom ltd the following week various stories have circulated about the origin of the foot stomping but its generally accepted that he did this to keep a strong tempo for his guitar playing—especially in the noisy bars and beer joints where he frequently performed after numerous complaints about damaged stage floors connors began to carry a piece of plywood that he stomped even more vigorously than before the stompin board became one of his trademarks after stomping a hole in the wood he would pick it up and show it to the audience accompanied by a joke about the quality of the local lumber before calling for a new one it was reported that when asked about his stompin board connors replied its just a stage im going through connors periodically auctioned off his stompin boards for charity with one board selling for 15000 in july 2011connorss favourite guitar was a gibson southern jumbo acoustic that he purchased in 1956 while on his way through ohio to nashville tennessee and mexico he discovered it in a furniture store hidden in a case on top of a shelf and after some haggling purchased it for 80 he had 90 with him the guitar was used to audition in 1964 at the maple leaf hotel in timmins as well as for writing bud the spud four years later although retired in 1972 it remained in his possession it has subsequently been refurbished a birthday gift from his wife lena the serial number inside the guitar reads 2222 in red stamped numbers and the actual age of the guitar is still unknownconnors released music on seven different labels his earliest foray into recording was on the ckgb timmins radio station label these 45 rpm singles were pressed by quality records in toronto and distributed and paid for primarily by tom his first two albums and two subsequent 45 rpm singles were released on the rebel records bluegrass label under the name tom connors these two albums were subsequently rereleased on dominion records under the stompin tom moniker and had to be totally rerecorded due to a dispute with rebel records owner john irvinemost of connorss wellknown albums were released on dominion records 1969–70 and after 1971 on the boot records label that he cofounded with jury krytiuk and mark altman his releases on dominion

the bulk of his recorded material it was released on 331⁄3 rpm record albums 45 rpm record singles 8tracks and cassette tapesafter his retreat from the music business in the late 1970s he started the act assisting canadian talent label in 1986 and released two albums stompin tom is back to assist canadian talent and his comeback album fiddle and songs in 1988 act also rereleased connorss back catalogue on cassette tapes onlyall of his subsequent releases and rereleases have been through capitol records emi most of this work is now available on compact disc in recent years many of his album releases have included at least one rerecording of one of his earlier songsconnors founded three record labels which promoted not just his own work but that of other canadian artistsamong artists who were featured on these labels were liona boyd rita macneil the canadian brass dixie flyers charlie panigoniak among others liona boyd recalled in 2013 about the time connors signed boyd to boot for her first record 1974s the guitar and two moreit was toms vision obviously and as i understood it he wasnt really a fan of classical music but he had heard canada had no classical label which was absolutely true so bless him he went and decided hed be the first one and he signed myself and the canadian brass its like me deciding well listen maybe i dont know much about rap but hey canadas doesnt have a rap label ill go and do it so he was a bit of a pioneer with classical musicin the book shake hands with the devil the failure of humanity in rwanda romeo dallaire the canadian general who led the unamir peacekeeping force in rwanda during that countrys 1994 genocide reported that he played a recording of connorss song the blue berets about united nations peacekeeping forces to keep up his troops morale while their headquarters was under bombardmentthe les claypool frog brigade mentions connors in the song long in the tooth on the album purple onion while corb lund references him in the song long gone to saskatchewan and dean brody references him in the song canadian girlstim hus also wrote a song titled man with the black hat about connorsthe following is a list of events in the history of canada which have been the subject of a song by connors who is widely renowned for singing about both wellknown and littleknown episodes in the countrys pastconnors married lena welsh on november 2 1973 the ceremony was broadcast live on elwood glovers luncheon date on cbc television during an interview on the show he said they had chosen to get married on television to share this happy moment with his fans across the country whose support had rescued him from a difficult preshowbusiness lifeconnors had a son taw connors he also had another son tom jrconnors was a heavy smoker—estimated to consume 100 cigarettes a day—and an equally heavy drinker on tour he had to drive the lead truck and could never be the last person to go to bed and that often meant that his fellow musicians had to keep up with his paceconnors always wore his black stetson in public and refused to remove it for any reason even when meeting queen elizabeth ii at a dinner in ottawa in october 2002 buckingham palace smoothed the way by likening mr connorss hat to a religious headdress such as a nuns habit or a sikhs turban however connors did go hatless during his nationallytelevised wedding on cbctv to lena welshas the 1970s progressed he retired to his farm at ballinafad near erin ontario to protest the lack of support given to canadian stories by the policies of the federal government particularly the canadian radiotelevision and telecommunications commission crtc he also boycotted the juno awards in protest of the qualification guidelines set by the canadian academy of recording arts and sciences caras for possible nominees who were being consistently nominated and awarded outside of their musical genre he strongly opposed artists who conducted most of their business in the united states being nominated for junos in canada connors who referred to these particular artists as turncoat canadians felt that in view of the fact that they had chosen to live and work in the us it was only fair that they competed with americans for grammy awards and left the juno competition to those who lived and conducted business in canadahis protest caught national attention when he sent back his six junos accompanied by a letter to the board of directorsgentlemeni am returning herewith the six juno awards that i once felt honoured to have received and which i am no longer proud to have in my possession as far as i am concerned you can give them to the border jumpers who didnt receive an award this year and maybe you can have them presented by charley pride i feel that the junos should be for people who are living in canada whose main base of business operations is in canada who are working toward the recognition of canadian talent in this country and who are trying to further the export of such talent from this country to the world with a view to proudly showing off what this country can contribute to the world marketuntil the academy appears to comply more closely with aspirations of this kind i will no longer stand for any nominations nor will i accept any award givenyours very trulystompin tom connorshe remained in retirement for 12 years only returning to the studio in 1986 to produce a new album to promote canadian artists that year tim vesely and dave bidini of rheostatics crashed his 50th birthday party and published an article about it in a toronto newspaper initiating a resurgence of public and record label interest in his work which resulted in the release in 1988 of fiddle and song his first new album since 1977connors music is rarely heard outside canada with the possible exception of his anthemic the hockey song which has been recorded by many artists and played regularly within the arenas of the national hockey league it has been suggested that connors refused to allow foreign release of his material although a more likely reason is that the very canadianspecific subject matter of many of his folk songs has resulted in limited demand in foreign markets when late night with conan obrien taped a weeks worth of shows in canada in 2004 connors was one of the guests of honour leading the toronto audience in a rendition of the hockey song this was one of the few times connors performed on american television another canadiantaped installment of late night

expressed interest for connors to do a music special since 1990 connors shot and edited a live concert presentation at hamilton place at a cost of over 200000 of his own money in september 2005 edwards said that a copy was presented to the cbcs head of tv variety and that he received a reply the next day telling him that a decision would be reached within a few weeks after 10 weeks another email was then sent to the newly appointed programming vp and a prompt reply came back that said that the broadcaster was moving away from music and variety programming and that the connors special did not fit with its strategyedwards said that he received another letter from the cbc that reinforced its lack of interest in the concert special but said that connors would have been a great guest to perform a song on the networks hockeyville series or an excellent subject for a life and times project in response connors saidas far as im concerned if the cbc our own public network will not reconsider their refusal to air a stompin tom special they can take their wonderful offer of letting me sing a song as a guest on some other program and shove itultimately the film was released on dvd
