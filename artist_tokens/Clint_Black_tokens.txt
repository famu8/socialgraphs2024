that he had a great voice by 15 black had learned to play guitar as a teenager black joined his elder brothers mark kevin and brian in their small band on saturday afternoons the family would host

becoming a solo actblack was initially drawn to a variety of musical genres according to his father he chose to focus on country music in the early 1980s after singers george strait and reba mcentire moved the genre back toward the more traditional in the style kept alive by george jones and merle haggard for six years black supported himself as a construction worker bait cutter and fishing guide while singing at various lounges as a solo singer and guitarist in 1987 at one of the gigs he met another guitarist hayden nicholas the two men connected musically and began a song writing partnership that would last decades in the late 1980s black delivered a demo of their collaboration nobodys home to record promoter sammy alfano within two days of that delivery black was invited to a meeting with bill ham who managed zz topblack soon signed with rca in october of 1987 and at the time rca was considered one of the most aggressive labels in country music his first album killin time was released in 1989 each song on the album was penned at least in part by black four of them were attributed solely to him while the rest were collaborations with nicholas in a departure from most other country albums black used his road band instead of session musicians to record killin time the album was a critical and commercial success reaching number one on the billboard country albums chart and certified platinum in 1990 he made his debut in 1989 with the single a better man which reached number one on the billboard hot country songs in early june this marked the first time in 14 years that

won the country music associations horizon award for best newcomer in 1989 at the end of the year his singles a better man and killin time place number one and number two on the yearend country singles charts it had been 36 years since another artist had claimed both top spots in a single year looking back at the early stages of his career black recalled at one point i knew i crossed this line out of obscurity and i felt like no matter what happened from that point on i would always be remembered for killin time there was this kind of mixed feeling of remorse and excitementin late 1990 the los angeles times surveyed country music industry insiders to determine which acts could be expected to sell the most records over the next seven years black placed second in the poll two votes behind garth brooks the survey results were surprising in that 10 of the top 20 artists named were relative newcomers to the industry in the past country music had been dominated by artists with several decades experience the plethora of new acts confused some reviewers however many reviewers lumped many of the new acts together as newsweeks david gates wrote good song good voice hot band who cares which one it is this time black soon became known as one of nashvilles hat acts like other country artists such as tracy lawrence alan jackson and john michael montgomery black was a relative newcomer who wore a hat and had clean neotraditional sound with pop appealkillin time was certified platinum in 1990 blacks second album put yourself in my shoes was released in november 1990 it reached number two on the country chart and was in the top 20 on the pop album charts this success on the pop charts resulted from a change in the way billboard calculated album sales a new reliance on nielsen soundscan instead of information from selected record stores showed that sales of country albums had previously been under counted the album did not meet with as much critical acclaim as his debut but nonetheless still included several hit singles he began touring with alabamablack has been a member of the grand ole opry since 1991in march 1992 black sued his manager bill ham for breach of contract black sought 2 million in damages and requested that ham return 4 million in royalties under the terms of their initial contract ham controlled all publishing royalties for any song that black wrote or cowrote for his first eight albums because black wrote all of his own music this amounted to a fee of 20 to 30 cents per album sold industry standards generally counseled songwriters to form their own publication companies so they would be able to retain more of the royaltiesham promptly countersued blaming the initial lawsuit on poor advice black received from his new personal assistant his motherinlaw jonni hartman his lawyer told the press that mr ham invested 1 million of his own money in clint blacks career at a time when nobody else would do so for that commitment mr black should show a little gratitude and honor his contractsby mid1992 blacks first two albums had sold a combined 5 million copies the difficulties with ham caused a delay in the release of blacks third album the hard way which was released on july 14 the album had been expected the year previously and during the delay the country music scene changed both alan jackson and travis tritt achieved greater success and billy ray cyrus became a teen idol the competition that black faced was now much stiffer than with his earlier albumsaccording to black he and producer james stroud spent more time putting this album together than either of those preceding and were a lot more aggressive in the way we cut and mixed the album black was also more satisfied with the vocals on this album several of the songs on the hard way including burn one down were initially reported to be blacks responses to his situation with ham co writer nicholas refuted the rumors maintaining that most of those songs were written in the late 1980sto promote the album black launched the hard way tour on june 26 1992 the tour ran for 11 months reviewers noticed that with this album black presented a new sexier image wearing tighter clothing and in many cases leaving behind his trademark hat black commented simply that he was bored wearing the hat all the timeblacks fourth album no time to kill was released almost a year after the hard way the album received mixed reviews the houston chronicle noted that blacks duet with wynonna judd a bad goodbye was precisely the kind of radioready bigproduction ballad that record companies tend to force on their artists when they sense that their careers are in troublet sticks out like a sore thumb in his body of work on the other hand a review in time magazine thought the duet helped black show his emotions more intensely some reviewers also noted that in some of the more serious songs on the album blacks voice sounded strained on january 30 1994 black performed as part of the rockin country sunday halftime show at super bowl xxvii along with judd tanya tucker travis tritt and naomi juddone emotion followed in late 1994 also a platinum certified album in the us this album accounted for five straight top five hits first was the number four untanglin my mind a merle haggard cowrite after it came the number three

1999 black released dlectrified which relied completely on acoustic instruments nevertheless usa today thought the album sounds as full and brash as an electric album since he used creative arrangements and horn sections three of the songs on the albums were remakes of previous black singles several others featured guest appearances by some of blacks idols including waylon jennings kenny loggins and eric idle the songs tended to be longer than most of those played on country radio with many stretching more than five minutesblack and hartman welcomed their first child lily pearl black

industry system he formed his own record label equity music group black admitted that it was difficult to leave rca in his 14 years with the label he had sold over 20 million recordsthe new label operated under very different rules than those black had begun his own career under artists were guaranteed ownership of their songs and were granted an equity stake in the label the first release from the new label was blacks next album spend my time his eighth studio album was blacks first release in five years the houston chronicle called it arguably the most adventurous of his careerin 2005

already have and spent three months listening to only that only stuff from before i started making records so it was pre1989—waylon willie buck owens haggard don williams jim croce and what i

material and although rca records often pushed black to record the material of other artists he refused black recorded only his own songs until 2007 when he released the single the strong one many of his songs were the result of a collaboration with hayden nicholas their first collaboration straight from the factory took them only 20 minutes to write although nicholas would later comment that most of em werent that easymany listeners were incredulous that such a young man 27 at the release of his first album could have such a remarkably mature perspective according to black to me a song is more than just something to sing its something to learn from its somebody elses true feeling im always trying to get at the meaning when i write a line im doing the same thing im looking at it from the perspective of if i was driving down the road listening to it what am i gon na get out of itmany of his songs make clever use of puns and other creative turns of phrase while the wordplay in many of the songs on his earlier albums was widely appreciated by the fourth album reviewers felt that the songs were not as high in quality rick mitchell of the houston chronicle stated his opinion that the hard way clever wordplay is no substitute for heartfelt emotionshortly after his music career took off he began receiving offers for acting roles he turned down every request until 1994 when he was
