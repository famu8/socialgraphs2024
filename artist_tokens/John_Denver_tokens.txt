aerobatic plane two cessna 210 centurion airplanes and a 1997 amateurbuilt rutan longezon april 21 1989 denver was in a plane accident while taxiing down the runway at holbrook municipal airport in his vintage 1931 biplane denver had stopped to refuel on a flight from carefree arizona to santa fe new mexico reports stated wind gusts caught the plane causing it to spin around and sustain extensive damage denver was not harmed in the incidentdenver died on the afternoon of october 12 1997 when his light homebuilt aircraft a rutan longez with registration number n555jd crashed into monterey bay near pacific grove california while making a series of touchandgo landings at the nearby monterey peninsula airport he was the planes only occupant the official cause of death was multiple blunt force trauma resulting from the crashdenver was a pilot with over 2700 hours of experience he had pilot ratings for singleengine land and sea multiengine land glider and instrument denver also held a type rating in his learjet he had recently purchased the longez aircraft made by someone else from a kit and had taken a halfhour checkout flight with the aircraft the day before his accidentdenver was not legally permitted to fly at the time of the crash in previous years he had been arrested several times for drunk driving in 1996 nearly a year before the accident the faa learned that denver had failed to maintain sobriety by not refraining entirely from alcohol and revoked his medical certification however it was determined that the crash was not caused or influenced by alcohol use an autopsy found no signs of alcohol or other drugs in denvers bodythe postaccident investigation by the national transportation safety board ntsb showed that the leading cause of the accident was denvers inability to switch fuel tanks during flight the quantity of fuel had been depleted during the planes flight to monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings denver performed at the airport immediately before the final flight his newly purchased amateurbuilt rutan aircraft had an unusual fuel tank selector valve handle configuration the handle had originally been intended by the planes designer to be between the pilots legs the builder instead put it behind the pilots left shoulder the fuel gauge was also placed behind the pilots seat and was not visible to the person at the controls an ntsb interview with the aircraft mechanic servicing denvers plane revealed that he and denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel selector valve handle and its resistance to being turnedbefore the flight denver and the mechanic had attempted to extend the reach of the handle using a pair of visegrip pliers but this did not solve the problem and the pilot still could not reach the handle while strapped into his seat ntsb officials postaccident investigation showed that because of the fuel selector valve ’ s positioning switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve this created a natural tendency to extend ones right foot against the right rudder pedal to support oneself while turning in the seat which caused the aircraft to yaw nose right and pitch upthe mechanic said that he told denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant denver had asked how much fuel was shown he told denver that there was less than half in the right tank and less than a quarter in the left tank he then provided denver with an inspection mirror so he could look over his shoulder at the fuel gauges the mirror was later recovered from the wreckage denver said that he would use the autopilot in flight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve he turned down an offer to refuel the aircraft saying that he would only be flying for about an hourthe ntsb interviewed 20 witnesses about denvers last flight six of them had seen the plane crash into the bay near point pinos four said the aircraft was originally heading west five said that they saw the plane in a steep bank with four saying that the bank was to the right north twelve described seeing the aircraft in a steep nosedown descent witnesses estimated the planes altitude between 350 and 500 feet 110 and 150 m when heading toward the shoreline eight said they heard a pop or backfire accompanied by a reduction in the engine noise level just before the plane crashed into the seain addition to denvers failing to refuel and his subsequent loss of control while attempting to switch fuel tanks the ntsb determined other key factors that led to the accident foremost among these was his inadequate transition training on this type of aircraft and the builders decision to put the fuel selector handle in a hardtoreach place the board issued recommendations on the requirement and enforcement of mandatory training standards for pilots operating homebuilt aircraft it also emphasized the importance of mandatory ease of access to all controls including fuel selectors and fuel gauges in all aircraftupon the announcement of denvers death colorado governor roy romer ordered all state flags to be lowered to halfstaff in his honor funeral services were held at faith presbyterian church in aurora colorado on october 17 1997 officiated by pastor les felker a retired air force chaplain
