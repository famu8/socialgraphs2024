served as vocalists browne quit the group after only a few months and was replaced by john mceuen who contributed on guitar mandolin banjo and washtub bass they briefly called themselves the illegitimate jug band due to their playing jug band music without actually having a member who played the jug soon afteward they selected nitty gritty dirt band as a name this name was inspired by their observation that many bands at the time had names which they considered long and unusual such as strawberry alarm clockjohns older brother william e mceuen served as the bands manager helping to book them as opening acts for artists such as joan baez he also helped the band sign a contract with liberty records who released the bands selftitled debut album in 1967 buy for me the rain was

differences in the bands sound and was replaced by multiinstrumentalist chris darrow formerly a member of kaleidoscope of their style at the time mary campbell of the associated press noted the bands use of acoustic instruments and rudimentary traditional folk instruments such as washtub bass kazoo and comb and paper she also noted that their clothing and song choices such as a cover of teddy bears picnic reflected the music and mindset of the 1920stheir third album 1968s rare junk was their first to feature electric guitar electric bass and drums although browne had left the band by this point they covered his these days on it johnny sandlin contributed on drums bob talbert of the state praised the album for the variety of instruments used noting that said variety allowed influences of jazz and country music on top of the groups existing jug band sound a year later liberty released a live album titled alive recorded at the troubadour in west hollywood california that same year the band contributed the song hand me down that can o beans to the soundtrack of the movie paint your wagon starring lee marvin the band briefly broke up in late 1969 during this hiatus hanna and darrow briefly founded a country rock band called the corvettes who recorded one session with michael nesmith of the monkees as producernitty gritty dirt band reunited in 1970 although darrow and barr declined to rejoin both were replaced by jimmy ibbotson who played bass guitar drums piano and accordion after reuniting the band issued its fourth liberty album uncle charlie his dog teddy that same

walkers mr bojangles the bands version of the song was their first major hit reaching number nine on the hot 100 also charting from the album were covers of kenny logginss house at pooh corner and nesmiths some of shellys blues richie unterberger of allmusic wrote of this album the group moved into a more accessible rockoriented fusion of country bluegrass pop and rock roll relying primarily on smartly chosen coversfew bands had incorporated instruments more commonly associated with country and bluegrass particularly mandolin and banjo as comfortably into a rock setting prior to this release and their wellcrafted harmonies help put the songs over for those notsteepedin backwoods soundsliberty records merged with united artists records in 1972 the bands first project for this label was 1972s all the good times the album had further cover songs on it including hank williamss jambalaya on the bayou and doug kershaws diggy liggy lo as well as another jackson browne cover jamaica the former of these was issued as a single but peaked in the lower end of the hot 100 hartford courant writer henry mcnulty found the cover songs superior to the original cuts on the album but criticized the band for including fake applause between tracksalso in 1972 the band traveled to nashville tennessee to record the album will the circle be unbroken this was a collaborative threedisc album featuring a number of country and bluegrass artists such as roy acuff maybelle carter earl scruggs and doc watson writing for the los angeles times robert hillburn thought that the band showed appreciation for the music of the collaborators and that the album would appeal to music fans who did not like the thencontemporary nashville sound the album also accounted for the bands first entries on the billboard hot country songs charts a cover of hank williamss i saw the light and the original grand ole opry song respectively featuring guest vocals from roy acuff and jimmy martin following the commercial success of will the circle be unbroken the band began touring across the united states and internationally mceuen also began recording as a solo artist at this point while maintaining his membership with the band larkin noted that critical reception of will the circle be unbroken played an important role in breaking down mistrust between countrys establishment and the emerging long hair practitioners similarly watson later attributed the albums success to renewed interest in his music particularly among fans of rock music who did not typically listen to folk and bluegrass the i saw the light cover accounted for the bands first grammy award nomination in the category of best country performance by a duo or group with vocal a year later the album itself was nominated in the same category in 1997 the project became the bands first album to be certified platinum by the recording industry association of america riaatheir next album for united artists was 1974s stars stripes forever by this point thompson had left as well leaving the band as a quartet a cover of johnny hortons the battle of new orleans charted from this project the album composed of both live and studio recordings also featured interview segments by fiddle player vassar clements bruce eder thought these elements made the album more than its moneys worth and capable of showing the bands mix of country and rock influences a year later they released symphonion dream led off by a cover of the everly brothers all i have to do is dream the album featured guest contributions from linda ronstadt leon russell and actor gary busey eder found influences of psychedelic rock and bluegrass in the instrumentation highlighting the instrumentals as well as in the other cover songs on the album such as hank williamss hey good lookin ibbotson left the band after this album after which point john cable and jackie clark joined these two alternated as bassists and guitarists soon after they joined nitty gritty dirt band toured in the soviet union becoming the first american act to do so the united states department of state oversaw the tour which lasted for 28 days this was followed by their first greatesthits package dirt silver and gold also in 1976in 1978 both clark and cable left the band which by this point had shortened its name to just the dirt band mceuen said that the decision to become just the dirt band was due to disc jockeys not being comfortable with the longer name conversely music writer tom roland attributed the name change to chuck morris who had taken over as the bands manager due to william e mceuen becoming overwhelmed by the role also according to john mceuen clark left voluntarily while he believes that hanna got rid of cable because he felt threatened by cables songwriting ability joining hanna john mceuen and fadden as members were drummer merel bergante bassist richard hathaway and al garth who played multiple instruments including saxophone and keyboards the bands first release under the shortened name was 1978s the dirt band in for the night reached the lower regions of the hot 100 as a single from this project stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic thought the album marked a shift in the bands sound to a soft rock style he thought the songs on the album were consistent in quality but also thought that the album would not appeal to fans of their earlier works also during 1978 the band appeared under the pseudonym the toot uncommons as backing musicians on comedian and actor steve martins novelty hit single king tut this appearance was due to william e mceuen serving as producer on the tracktheir second album as the dirt band was 1979s an american dream the albums title track written by rodney crowell was released as a single in 1980 the song featured a backing vocal from linda ronstadt it accounted for their secondhighest hot 100 peak of 13 and was also their first appearance on the billboard country music charts since 1973 during the release of this album michael buono took over for bergante on drums while bob carpenter joined as keyboardist next was 1980s make a little magic featuring backing vocals from nicolette larson its title track was a number 25 hit on the hot 100 ken paulson of the fort myers florida news press noted that unlike their previous albums it contained only one cover song specifically cidny bullenss anxious heart he thought that by focusing more on original material the album showed the band members strengths as songwriters and performers and considered it their best album yetafter this album emi eliminated the united artists label and reopened liberty records transferring the band back to that label after a decade their first release upon returning to liberty was 1981s jealousy most of the band members wrote the songs on the album by themselves and hanna coproduced the album also by this point vic mastrionni had become the bands drummer fire in the sky was released as a single the title track was as well but it did not chart the album featured guest vocals from rosemary butler and kenny loggins an uncredited review in the new jersey daily record panned the albums soft rock sound and lack of variety between tracks as well as the songs on which carpenter sang lead vocals likewise erlewine thought that the band never quite mustered the soft rock sound of the album and criticized many of the songs for lacking hooksin 1983 the band reverted its name to nitty gritty dirt band al garth and vic mastrionni both quit the band at this point and ibbotson rejoined as a vocalist and bass guitarist as a result fadden began playing drums in addition to his existing role as harmonica player at this point the band began finding success in country music a move which mceuen attributed to changing tastes among fans of rock and pop music roland also attributes the shift in sound and reversion of their name to morris mceuen also attributed both of these and the return of ibbotson to the lineup as being decisions made by morris the first release to be successful on the country charts was shot full of love which went to number 19 on the hot country songs charts in 1983 this was followed by ibbotsons composition dance little jean which went to number nine both were included on the album lets go their last after rejoining liberty this album was produced by norbert putnam and richard landisthe band began recording their next album plain dirt fashion while still on liberty however morris was uncertain if the label would promote the album properly as it was the last one in their contract as a result the band transferred to warner records who released it in 1984 furthering their move to country music they also switched booking agents which resulted in them opening shows for ricky skaggs and hank williams jr paul worley and marshall morgan served as producers on the project according to ibbotson the band chose to switch producers after moving to warner as they thought putnam and landis despite working in country music thought they had to cover all bases in addition to the five members of the band other contributors included skaggs and jerry douglas the project also included a cover of bruce springsteens cadillac ranch the lead single was another rodney crowell composition long hard road the sharecroppers dream which in 1984 became the bands first numberone single on the billboard country charts also issued as singles were i love only you written by dave loggins and don schlitz and high horse written by ibbotson both of which were topfive country hits between late 1984 and early 1985 writing for the mattoon illinois journal gazette rickey ferguson thought that the album showed a country influence through the storytelling lyrics of long hard roadnext on warner was partners brothers and friends in 1985 the albums lead single was modern day romance written by kix brooks who would later become onehalf of brooks dunn upon release this song became nitty gritty dirt bands second numberone on the billboard country charts although hanna or carpenter usually sang lead vocals on singles modern day romance was one of several in this timespan to feature ibbotson on lead vocals instead worley noted that the song had originally been submitted to the band for inclusion on plain dirt fashion but was rejected and they chose to record it after it was submitted to them a second time also charting in the top ten from this album were home again in my heart and the title track which hanna and ibbotson cowrote while not released as a single the album track telluride also written by ibbotson was made into a music video robert k oermann of the tennessean noted that the lyrics of partners brothers and friends contained several

several stops on the tour include jason isbell as an opening actnitty gritty dirt bands music encompasses a wide variety of styles colin larkin in the virgin encyclopedia of country music wrote that their early albums contained jug band and vaudeville influences while by the release of uncle charlie and his dog teddy the band abandoned the jokey elements pursued a career as purveyors of superior country rock mark deming spoke similarly of their early material noting influences of bluegrass in the mr bojangles cover as well as the tracks from the first will the circle be unbroken album he also defined the bands late1970s output as soft rock and that their 1990s and 21stcentury material was indebted to american folk music on the same site stephen thomas erlewine also noticed influences of soft rock on the dirt band rickey ferguson thought the bands country influences were more evident on plain dirt fashion due to the use of instruments such as dobro fiddle and mandolin holly gleason noted the twang evident in hannas and ibbotsons singing voices and thought the bands rhythm sections were stronger than usual for a country bandduring the release of will the circle be unbroken the band members were noted for their longhaired appearance which at the time was considered counter to the appearances of country music acts at the time bill monroe was said to have refused an offer to appear on the album and roy acuff was initially apprehensive before joining the band said that an impetus behind their shift to country music in the 1980s was the lack of a successful pop song after an american dream and make a little magic followed by a realization that members of the country music community in nashville were still fans of their music they also thought that the first two will the circle be unbroken projects helped to dim the lines between pop and country especially since the genre of country rock was still new when the first one was recorded walter tunis of the lexington heraldleader thought that the band was an early example of the californiabased country rock movement of the 1970s furthered by bands such as the flying burrito brothers and eagles and that such a comparison was furthered when leadon a former member of both bands joined he also thought that the bands success in country in the 1980s was more indebted to marketing and changes in taste from listeners more so than a shift in sound within the band itself leadon also stated that he heard influences of the eagles within the nitty gritty dirt bands songs jim wensits of the south bend tribune described the band as a coming force in country rock during the success of mr bojangles and added that they confounded critics by refusing to be categorized he also thought that the bands sound during the 1970s was comparable to the eagles and that some songs such as their cover of jambalaya featured influences of cajun musicin a 2022 concert review jeffrey b remz of country standard time opined that jeff hannas voice was well intact at 75 and that he had an affable easy going stage presence he also noted that jaime hanna carpenter and fadden occasionally sang lead vocals as well he also praised the use of fiddle and mandolin in their live settingscurrent membersformer members
