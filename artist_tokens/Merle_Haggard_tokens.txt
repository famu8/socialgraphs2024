country music star thencalifornia governor ronald reagan granted haggard a full and unconditional pardon for his past crimesupon his release from san quentin in 1960 haggard started digging ditches for his brothers electrical contracting company soon he was performing again and later began recording with tally records the bakersfield sound was developing in the area as a reaction against the overproduced nashville sound haggards first record for tally was singing my heart out backed by skid row it was not a success and only 200 copies were pressed in 1962 haggard wound up performing at a wynn stewart show in las vegas and heard wynns sing a sad song he asked for permission to record it and the resulting single was a national hit in 1964 the following year he had his first national top10 record with my friends are gon na be strangers written by liz anderson mother of country singer lynn anderson and his career was off and running haggard recalls having been talked into visiting anderson—a woman he did not know—at her house to hear her sing some songs she had written if there was anything i didnt wan na do it was sit around some danged womans house and listen to her cute little songs but i went anyway she was a pleasant enough lady pretty with a nice smile but i was all set to be bored to death even more so when she got out a whole bunch of songs and went over to an old pump organ there they were my god one hit right after another there must have been four or five number one songs therein 1967 haggard recorded im a lonesome fugitive with the strangers also written by liz anderson with her husband casey anderson which became his first numberone single when the andersons presented the song to haggard they were unaware of his prison stretch bonnie owens haggards backup singer and thenwife is quoted by music journalist daniel cooper in the liner notes to the 1994 retrospective down every road i guess i didnt realize how much the experience at san quentin did to him cause he never talked about it all that much i could tell he was in a dark mood and i said is everything okay and he said im really scared and i said why and he said cause im afraid someday im gon na be out there and theres gon na be some prisoner in there the same time i was in stand up—and theyre gon na be about the third row down—and say what do you think youre doing 45200 cooper notes that the news had little effect on haggards career its unclear when or where merle first acknowledged to the public that his prison songs were rooted in personal history for to his credit he doesnt seem to have made some big splash announcement in a may 1967 profile in music city news his prison record is never mentioned but in july 1968 in the very same publication its spoken of as if it were common knowledgethe 1967 album branded man with the strangers kicked off an artistically and commercially successful run for haggard in 2013 haggard biographer david cantwell stated the immediate successors to im a lonesome fugitive—branded man in 1967 and in 68 sing me back home and the legend of bonnie and clyde—were among the finest albums of their respective years haggards new recordings showcased his band the strangers specifically roy nicholss telecaster ralph mooneys steel guitar and the harmony vocals provided by bonnie owensat the time of haggards first top10 hit my friends are gon na be strangers in 1965 owens who had been married to buck owens was known as a solo performer a fixture on the bakersfield club scene and someone who had appeared on television she won the new academy of country musics first ever award for female vocalist after her 1965 debut album dont take advantage of me hit the top five on the country albums chart however bonnie owens had no further hit singles and although she recorded six solo albums on capitol between 1965 and 1970 she became mainly known for her background harmonies on haggard hits such as sing me back home and branded manproducer ken nelson took a handsoff approach to produce haggard in the episode of american masters dedicated to him haggard remembers the producer i had at that time ken nelson was an exception to the rule he called me mr haggard and i was a little twentyfour twentyfiveyearold punk from oildale he gave me complete responsibility i think if hed jumped in and said oh you cant do that it wouldve destroyed me in the documentary series lost highway nelson recalls when i first started recording merle i became so enamored with his singing that i would forget what else was going on and i suddenly realized wait a minute theres musicians here youve got to worry about but his songs—he was a great writertowards the end of the decade haggard composed several numberone hits including mama tried the legend of bonnie and clyde hungry eyes and sing me back home daniel cooper calls sing me back home a ballad that works on so many different levels of the soul it defies ones every attempt to analyze it in a 1977 interview in billboard with bob eubanks haggard reflected even though the crime was brutal and the guy was an incorrigible criminal its a feeling you never forget when you see someone you know make that last walk they bring him through the yard and theres a guard in front and a guard behind—thats how you know a death prisoner they brought rabbit out taking him to see the father prior to his execution that was a strong picture that was left in my mind in 1969 haggards first tribute lp same train different time a tribute to jimmie rodgers was also released to acclaimin the 1969 rolling stone review for haggard and the strangers 1968 album mama tried andy wickham wrote his songs romanticize the hardships and tragedies of americas transient proletarian and his success is resultant of his inherent ability to relate to his audience a commonplace experience with precisely the right emotional pitch merle haggard looks the part and sounds the part because he is the part hes greatin 1969 haggard and the strangers released okie from muskogee with lyrics ostensibly reflecting the singers pride in being from middle america where people are conventionally patriotic and traditionally conservative american president richard nixon wrote an appreciative letter to haggard upon his hearing of the song and would go on to invite haggard to perform at the white house several timesin the ensuing years haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values in a 2001 interview haggard called the song a documentation of the uneducated that lived in america at the time however he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously on the bob edwards show he said i wrote it when i recently got out of the joint i knew what it was like to lose my freedom and i was getting really mad at these protesters they didnt know anything more about the war in vietnam than i did i thought how my dad who was from oklahoma would have felt i felt i knew how those boys fighting in vietnam felt in the country music documentary series lost highway he elaborated my dad passed away when i was nine and i dont know if youve ever thought about somebody youve lost and you say i wonder what soandso would think about this i was drivin on interstate 40 and i saw a sign that said 19 miles to muskogee while at the same time listening to radio shows of the world tomorrow hosted by garner ted armstrong muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as back home so i saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and i thought i wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time the janis joplins i understood em i got along with it but what if he was to come alive at this moment and i thought what a way to describe the kind of people in america that are still sittin in the center of the country sayin what is goin on on these campuses as it was the subject of this garner ted armstrong radio program and a week or so later i was listening to garner ted armstrong and armstrong was saying how the smaller colleges in smaller towns dont seem to have any problems and i wondered if muskogee had a college and it did and they hadnt had any trouble no racial problems and no dope problems the whole thing hit me in two minutes and i did one line after another and got the whole thing done in 20 minutes in the american masters documentary about him he said thats how i got into it with the hippies i thought they were unqualified to judge america and i thought they were lookin down their noses at something that i cherished very much and it pissed me off and i thought you sons of bitches youve never been restricted away from this great wonderful country and yet here you are in the streets bitchin about things protesting about a war that they didnt know any more about than i did they werent over there fightin that war any more than i washaggard began performing the song in concert in 1969 and was astounded at the reaction it receivedthe haggard camp knew they were on to something everywhere they went every show okie did more than prompt enthusiastic applause there was an unanticipated adulation racing through the crowds now standing ovations that went on and on and sometimes left the audience and the band members alike tearyeyed merle had somehow stumbled upon a song that expressed previously inchoate fears spoke out loud gripes and anxieties otherwise only whispered and now people were using his song were using him to connect themselves to these larger concerns and to one anotherthe studio version which was mellower than the usually raucous liveconcert versions topped the country charts in 1969 and remained there for a month it also hit number 41 on the billboard allgenre singles chart becoming haggards biggest hit up to that time surpassed only by his 1973 crossover christmas hit if we make it through december which peaked at number 28 okie from muskogee is also generally described as haggards signature songon his next single the fightin side of me released by his record company in 1970 over haggards objections haggards lyrics stated that he did not mind the counterculture switchin sides and standin up for what they believe in but resolutely declared if you dont love it leave it in may 1970 haggard explained to john grissom of rolling stone i dont like their views on life their filth their visible selfdisrespect yknow they dont give a shit what they look like or what they smell like what do they have to offer humanity in a 2003 interview with no depression magazine haggard said i had different views in the 70s as a human being ive learned i have more culture now i was dumb as a rock when i wrote okie from muskogee thats being honest with you at the moment and a lot of things that i said i sing with a different intention now my views on marijuana have totally changed i think we were brainwashed and i think anybody that doesnt know that needs to get up and read and look around get their own information its a cooperative government project to make us think marijuana should be outlawedhaggard had wanted to follow okie from muskogee with irma jackson a song that dealt with an interracial romance between a white man and an african american woman his producer ken nelson discouraged him from releasing it as a single jonathan bernstein recounts hoping to distance himself from the harshly rightwing image he had accrued in the wake of the hippiebashing muskogee haggard wanted to take a different direction and release irma jackson as his next single when the bakersfield california native brought the song to his record label executives were reportedly appalled in the wake of okie capitol records was not interested in complicating haggards conservative bluecollar imageafter the fightin side of me was released instead haggard later commented to the wall street journal people are narrowminded down south they might have called me a nigger lover in a 2001 interview haggard stated that nelson who was also head of the country division at capitol at the time never interfered with his music but this one time he came out and said merle i dont believe the world is ready for this yet and he might have been right i mightve canceled out where i was headed in my careerokie from muskogee the fightin side of me and i wonder if they think of me haggards 1973 song about an american pow in vietnam were hailed as anthems of the silent majority and have been recognized as part of a recurring patriotic trend in american country music that also includes charlie daniels in america and lee greenwoods god bless the usa although gordon friesen of broadside magazine criticized haggard for his birch–type songs against war dissenters haggard was popular with college students in the early 1970s not only because of the ironic use of his songs by counterculture members but also because his music was recognized as coming from an early countryfolk tradition both okie from muskogee and the fightin side of me received extensive airplay on underground radio stations and okie was performed in concert by protest singers arlo guthrie and phil ochshaggards 1970 lp a tribute to the best damn fiddle player in the world dedicated to bob wills helped spark a permanent revival and expanded the audience for western swing by this point haggard was one of the most famous country singers in the world having enjoyed an immensely successful artistic and commercial run with capitol accumulating 24 numberone country singles since 1966in 1972 let me tell you about a song the first tv special starring haggard was nationally syndicated by capital cities tv productions it was a semiautobiographical musical profile of haggard akin to the contemporary behind the music produced and directed by michael davis the
