thomas jonathan stonewall jackson january 21 1824 – may 10 1863 was a confederate general and military officer who served during the american civil war he played a prominent role in nearly all military engagements in the eastern theater of the war until his death military historians regard him as one of the most gifted tactical commanders in us historyborn in what was then part of virginia

sumter jackson joined the confederate states army he distinguished himself commanding a brigade at the first battle of bull run in july providing crucial reinforcements and beating back a fierce union assault thus barnard elliott bee jr compared him to a stone wall which became his enduring nicknamehe performed exceptionally well in various campaigns over the next two years on may 2 1863 jackson was accidentally shot by confederate pickets he lost his left arm to amputation weakened by his wounds he died of pneumonia eight days later his death proved a severe setback for the confederacy after jacksons death his military exploits developed a legendary quality becoming an important element of the pseudohistorical ideology of the lost causethomas jonathan jackson was a greatgrandson of john jackson 17151719–1801 and elizabeth cummins also known as elizabeth comings and elizabeth needles 1723–1828 john jackson was an irish protestant from coleraine county londonderry ireland while living

julia beckwith née neale jackson 1798–1831 and jonathan jackson 1790–1826 an attorney both of jacksons parents were natives of virginia the family already had two young children and were living in clarksburg in what is now west virginia when thomas was born he was named for his maternal grandfather there is some dispute about the actual location of jacksons birth a historical marker on the floodwall in parkersburg west virginia claims that he was born in a cabin near that spot when his mother was visiting her parents who lived there there are writings which indicate that in jacksons early childhood he was called the real macaroni though the origin of the nickname and whether it really existed are unclearthomass sister elizabeth age six died of typhoid fever on march 6 1826 with twoyearold thomas at her bedside his father also died of a typhoid fever on march 26 1827 after nursing his daughter jacksons mother gave birth to his sister laura ann the day after jacksons father died julia jackson thus was widowed at 28 and was left with much debt and three young children including the newborn she sold the familys possessions to pay the debts she declined family charity and moved into a small rented oneroom house julia took in sewing and opened a private school to support herself and her three young children for about four yearsin 1830 julia neale jackson remarried against the wishes of her friends her new husband captain blake b woodson an attorney did not like his stepchildren warren julias eldest son moved to live with his uncle alfred neale near parkersburg and at the age of sixteen he was hired to teach in upshur county julia moved to fayette county with her other two children thomas and laura julia remained in such poor health and caring for the children was such a strain on her strength that she agreed to let their grandmother jackson take them to her home in lewis county about four miles north of weston where she lived with her unmarried daughters and sons one of these sons was sent to fayette county to care for the children by the grandmother when he arrived and the purpose of his visit was revealed there was quite a commotion among the children who were very reluctant to leave their mother thomas now six years old slipped away to the nearby woods where he hid only returning to the house at nightfall after a day or two of coaxing and numerous bribes the uncle finally persuaded the children to make the trip which took several days with the help of their mother when they arrived at their destination they became the pets of an indulgent grandmother two maiden aunts and several bachelor uncles all of whom were known for their great kindness of heart and strong family attachment thomas and laura were indulged in every way and to an extent well calculated to spoil them in august 1835 thomas and lauras grandmother diedthe following year after giving birth to thomass halfbrother willam wirt woodson julia died of complications leaving her three older children orphaned julia was buried in an unmarked grave in a homemade coffin in westlake cemetery along the james river and kanawha turnpike in fayette county within the corporate limits of presentday ansted west virginiaas their mothers health continued to fail jackson and his sister laura ann were sent to live with their halfuncle cummins jackson who owned a grist mill in jacksons mill near presentday weston in lewis county in central west virginia their older brother warren went to live with other relatives on his mothers side of the family but he later died of tuberculosis in 1841 at the age of twenty thomas and laura ann returned from jacksons mill in november 1831 to be at their dying mothers bedside they spent four years together at the mill before being separated—laura ann was sent to live with her mothers family thomas to live with his aunt polly his fathers sister and her husband isaac brake on a farm four miles from clarksburg thomas was treated by brake as an outsider and having suffered verbal abuse for over a year ran away from the family when his cousin in clarksburg urged him to return to aunt pollys he replied maybe i ought to maam but i am not going to he walked eighteen miles through mountain wilderness to jacksons mill where he was welcomed by his uncles and he remained there for the following seven yearscummins jackson was strict with thomas who looked up to cummins as a schoolteacher jackson helped around the farm tending sheep with the assistance of a sheepdog driving teams of oxen and helping harvest wheat and corn formal education was not easily obtained but he attended school when and where he could much of jacksons education was selftaught he once made a deal with one of his uncles slaves to provide him with pine knots in exchange for reading lessons thomas would stay up at night reading borrowed books by the light of those burning pine knots virginia law forbade teaching a slave free black or mulatto to read or write nevertheless jackson secretly taught the slave as he had promised once literate the young slave fled to canada via the underground railroad in his later years at jacksons mill thomas served as a schoolteacherthe civil war has sometimes been referred to as a war of brother against brother but in the case of the jackson family it was brother against sister laura jackson arnold was close to her brother thomas until the civil war period as the war loomed she became a staunch unionist in a somewhat divided harrison county she was so strident in her beliefs that she expressed mixed feelings upon hearing of thomass death one union officer said that she seemed depressed at hearing the news but her unionism was stronger than her family bonds in a letter he wrote that laura had said that she would rather know that he was dead than to have him a leader in the rebel army her union sentiment also estranged her later from her husband jonathan arnoldin 1842 jackson was accepted to the united states military academy at west point new york because of his inadequate schooling he had difficulty with the entrance examinations and began his studies at the bottom of his class displaying a dogged determination that was to characterize his life he became one of the hardest working cadets in the academy and moved steadily up the academic rankings jackson graduated 17th out of 59 students in the class of 1846 general daniel harvey hill later remembered that jacksons peers at west point had said of jackson if the course had been one year longer he would have graduated at the head of his classjackson began his united states army career as a second lieutenant in company k of the 1st us artillery regiment his unit proceeded through pennsylvania down the ohio and mississippi rivers to new orleans and from there the troops embarked for point isabel texas from where they were sent to fight in the mexican–american war jacksons unit was directed to report to general taylor and proceed immediately via matamoros and camargo to monterey and then to saltillo prior to the battle of buena vista lieutenant jacksons unit was ordered to withdraw from general taylors army and march to the mouth of the rio grande where they would be transferred to veracruz he served at the siege of veracruz and the battles of contreras chapultepec and mexico city eventually earning two brevet promotions and the regular army rank of first lieutenant it was in mexico that jackson first met robert e leeduring the battle of chapultepec on september 13 1847 he refused what he felt was a bad order to withdraw his troops confronted by his superior he explained his rationale claiming withdrawal was more hazardous than continuing his overmatched artillery duel his judgment proved correct and a relieving brigade was able to exploit the advantage jackson had broached in contrast to this display of strength of character he obeyed what he also felt was a bad order when he raked a civilian throng with artillery fire after the mexican authorities failed to surrender mexico city at the hour demanded by the us forces the former episode and later aggressive action against the retreating mexican army earned him field promotion to the brevet rank of majorafter the war jackson was briefly assigned to units in new york and later to florida during the second interbellum of the seminole wars during which the americans were attempting to force the remaining seminoles to move west he was stationed briefly at fort casey before being named secondincommand at fort meade a small fort about thirty miles south of tampa his commanding officer was major william h french jackson and french disagreed often and filed numerous complaints against each other jackson stayed in florida less than a yearin the spring of 1851 jackson accepted a newly created teaching position at the virginia military institute vmi he became professor of natural and experimental philosophy or physics and instructor of artilleryjackson was disliked as a teacher with his students nicknaming him tom fool believing that jackson could never be anything more than a martinet colonel half soldier and half preacher he memorized his lectures and then recited them to the class students who came to ask for help were given the same explanation as before if a student asked for help a second time jackson simply repeated the explanation slower and more deliberately in 1856 a group of alumni attempted to have jackson removed from his positionthe founder of vmi and one of its first two faculty members was john thomas lewis preston prestons second wife margaret junkin preston was the sister of jacksons first wife elinor in addition to working together on the vmi faculty preston taught sunday school with jackson and served on his staff during the civil warjackson was not known to the white inhabitants of lexington instead mostly being known by many of the african americans in town both slaves and free blacks in 1855 he organized sunday school classes for blacks at the presbyterian church his second wife mary anna jackson taught with jackson as he preferred that my labors should be given to the colored children believing that it was more important and useful to put the strong hand of the gospel under the ignorant african race to lift them up the pastor dr william spottswood white described the relationship between jackson and his sunday afternoon students in their religious instruction he succeeded wonderfully his discipline was systematic and firm but very kind his servants reverenced and loved him as they would have done a brother or father he was emphatically the black mans friend he addressed his students by name and they referred to him as marse majorjackson owned six slaves in the late 1850s three hetty cyrus and george a mother and two teenage sons were received as part of the dowry at his marriage to mary anna jackson another slave albert requested that jackson purchase him and allow him to work for his freedom he was employed as a waiter in one of the lexington hotels and jackson rented him to vmi amy also requested that jackson purchase her from a public slave auction and she served the family as a cook and housekeeper the sixth emma was a fouryearold orphan with a learning disability accepted by jackson from an aged widow and presented to his second wife mary anna as a welcomehome gift after jackson was shot at chancellorsville a slave jim lewis had stayed with jackson in the small house as he lay dying mary anna jackson in her 1895 memoir said our servants without the firm guidance and restraint of their master the excitement of the times proved so demoralizing to them that he deemed it best for me to provide them with good homes among the permanent residents james robertson wrote about jacksons view on slaveryjackson neither apologized for nor spoke in favor of the practice of slavery he probably opposed the institution yet in his mind the creator had sanctioned slavery and man had no moral right to challenge its existence the good christian slaveholder was one who treated his servants fairly and humanely at all timeswhile an instructor at vmi in 1853 thomas jackson married elinor ellie junkin whose father george junkin was president of washington college later named washington and lee university in lexington an addition was built onto the presidents residence for the jacksons and when robert e lee became president of washington college he lived in the same home now known as the lee–jackson house ellie gave birth to a stillborn son on october 22 1854 experiencing a hemorrhage an hour later that proved fatalafter a tour of europe jackson married again in 1857 mary anna morrison was from north carolina where her father was the first president of davidson college her sister isabella morrison was married to daniel harvey hill mary anna had a daughter named mary graham on april 30 1858 but the baby died less than a month later another daughter was born in 1862 shortly before her fathers death the jacksons named her julia laura after his mother and sisterjackson purchased the only house he ever owned while in lexington built in 1801 the brick town house at 8 east washington street was purchased by jackson in 1859 he lived in it for two years before being called to serve in the confederacy jackson never returned to his homein november 1859 at the request of the governor of virginia major william gilham led a contingent of the vmi cadet corps to charles town to provide an additional military presence at the hanging of militant abolitionist john brown on december 2 following his raid on the federal arsenal at harpers ferry on october 16 major jackson was placed in command of the artillery consisting of two howitzers manned by twentyone cadetsin april 1861 after virginia seceded from the union and as the american civil war broke out jackson was ordered by the governor of virginia to report with the vmi cadet corps to richmond and await further orders upon arrival jackson was appointed a major of engineers in the provisional army of virginia which was a short lived force commanded by robert e lee prior to virginia fully augmenting into forces of the confederacy after jackson protested such a low rank the virginia governor appointed him a colonel of virginia infantry which in may 1861 was augmented to a colonel in the confederate army jackson then became a drill master for some of the many new recruits in the confederate armyon april 27 1861 virginia governor john letcher ordered colonel jackson to take command at harpers ferry where he would assemble and command the unit which later gained fame as the stonewall brigade consisting of the 2nd 4th 5th 27th and 33rd virginia infantry regiments these units were from the shenandoah valley region of virginia where jackson located his headquarters throughout the first two years of the war as well as counties in western virginia jackson became known for his relentless drilling of his troops he believed discipline was vital to success on the battlefield following raids on the bo railroad on may 24 he was promoted to brigadier general on june 17 1861 jackson continued to wear a blue union army uniform up to this point having only access to his old vmi majors jacket and would not be issued with a gray confederate uniform until 1862jackson rose to prominence and earned his most famous nickname at the first battle of bull run first manassas on july 21 1861 as the confederate lines began to crumble under heavy union assault jacksons brigade provided crucial reinforcements on henry house hill demonstrating the discipline he instilled in his men while under heavy fire for several continuous hours jackson received a wound breaking the middle finger of his left hand about midway between the hand and knuckle the ball passing on the side next to the index finger the troops of south carolina commanded by gen barnard elliott bee jr had been overwhelmed and he rode up to jackson in despair exclaiming they are beating us back then said jackson we will give them the bayonet as he rode back to his command bee exhorted his own troops to reform by shouting there is jackson standing like a stone wall let us determine to die here and we will conquer rally behind the virginians there is some controversy over bees statement and intent which could not be clarified because he was killed almost immediately after speaking and none of his subordinate officers wrote reports of the battle major burnett rhett chief of staff to general joseph e johnston claimed that bee was angry at jacksons failure to come immediately to the relief of bees and francis s bartows brigades while they were under heavy pressure those who subscribe to this opinion believe that bees statement was meant to be pejorative look at jackson standing there like a stone wallregardless of the controversy and the delay in relieving bee jacksons brigade which would thenceforth be known as the stonewall brigade stopped the union assault and suffered more casualties than any other southern brigade that day jackson has since then been generally known as stonewall jackson during the battle jackson displayed a gesture common to him and held his left arm skyward with the palm facing forward – interpreted by his soldiers variously as an eccentricity or an entreaty to god for success in combat his hand was struck by a bullet or a piece of shrapnel and he suffered a small loss of bone in his middle finger he refused medical advice to have the finger amputated after the battle jackson was promoted to major general october 7 1861 and given command of the valley district with headquarters in winchesterin the spring of 1862 union maj gen george b mcclellans army of the potomac approached richmond from the southeast in the peninsula campaign maj gen irvin mcdowells large corps was poised to hit richmond from the north and maj gen nathaniel p bankss army threatened the shenandoah valley jackson was ordered by richmond to operate in the valley to defeat bankss threat and prevent mcdowells troops from reinforcing mcclellanjackson possessed the attributes to succeed against his poorly coordinated and sometimes timid opponents a combination of great audacity excellent knowledge and shrewd use of the terrain and an uncommon ability to inspire his troops to great feats of marching and fightingthe campaign started with a tactical defeat at kernstown on march 23 1862 when faulty intelligence led him to believe he was attacking a small detachment but it became a strategic victory for the confederacy because his aggressiveness suggested that he possessed a much larger force convincing president abraham lincoln to keep banks troops in the valley and mcdowells 30000man corps near fredericksburg subtracting about 50000 soldiers from mcclellans invasion force as it transpired it was jacksons only defeat in the valleyby adding maj gen richard s ewells large division and maj gen edward allegheny johnsons small division jackson increased his army to 17000 men he was still significantly outnumbered but attacked portions of his divided enemy individually at mcdowell defeating both brig gens robert h milroy and robert c schenck he defeated banks at front royal and winchester ejecting him from the valley lincoln decided that the defeat of jackson was an immediate priority though jacksons orders were solely to keep union forces occupied and away from richmond he ordered irvin mcdowell to send 20000 men to front royal and maj gen john c frémont to move to harrisonburg if both forces could converge at strasburg jacksons only escape route up the valley would be cutafter a series of maneuvers jackson defeated frémonts command at cross keys and brig gen james shields at port republic on june 8–9 union forces were withdrawn from the valleyit was a classic military campaign of surprise and maneuver jackson pressed his army to travel 646 miles 1040 km in 48 days of marching and won five significant victories with a force of about 17000 against a combined force of 60000 stonewall jacksons reputation for moving his troops so rapidly earned them the oxymoronic nickname foot cavalry he became the most celebrated soldier in the confederacy until he was eventually eclipsed by lee and lifted the morale of the southern publicmcclellans peninsula campaign toward richmond stalled at the battle of seven pines on may 31 and june 1 after the valley campaign ended in midjune jackson and his troops were called to join robert e lees army of northern virginia in defense of the capital by using a railroad tunnel under the blue ridge mountains and then transporting troops to hanover county on the virginia central railroad jackson and his forces made a surprise appearance in front of mcclellan at mechanicsville reports had last placed jacksons forces in the shenandoah valley their presence near richmond added greatly to the union commanders overestimation of the strength and numbers of the forces before him this proved a crucial factor in mcclellans decision to reestablish his base at a point many miles downstream from richmond on the james river at harrisons landing essentially a retreat that ended the peninsula campaign and prolonged the war almost three more yearsjacksons troops served well under lee in the series of battles known as the seven days battles but jacksons own performance in those battles is generally considered to be poor he arrived late at mechanicsville and inexplicably ordered his men to bivouac for the night within clear earshot of the battle he was late at savages station at white oak swamp he failed to employ fording places to cross white oak swamp creek attempting for hours to rebuild a bridge which limited his involvement to an ineffectual artillery duel and a missed opportunity to intervene decisively at the battle of glendale which was raging nearby at malvern hill jackson participated in the futile piecemeal frontal assaults against entrenched union infantry and massed artillery and suffered heavy casualties but this was a problem for all of lees army in that illconsidered battle the reasons for jacksons sluggish and poorly coordinated actions during the seven days are disputed although a severe lack of sleep after the grueling march and railroad trip from the shenandoah valley was probably a significant factor both jackson and his troops were completely exhausted an explanation for this and other lapses by jackson was tersely offered by his colleague and brother inlaw general daniel harvey hill jacksons genius never shone when he was under the command of anotherthe military reputations of lees corps commanders are often characterized as stonewall jackson representing the audacious offensive component of lees army whereas his counterpart james longstreet more typically advocated and executed defensive strategies and tactics jackson has been described as the armys hammer longstreet its anvil in the northern virginia campaign of august 1862 this stereotype did not hold true longstreet commanded the right wing later to become known as the first corps and jackson commanded the left wing jackson started the campaign under lees orders with a sweeping flanking maneuver that placed his corps into the rear of union maj gen john popes army of virginia the hotchkiss journal shows that jackson most likely originally conceived the movement in the journal entries for march 4 and 6 1863 general stuart tells hotchkiss that jackson was entitled to all the credit for the movement and that lee thought the proposed movement very hazardous and reluctantly consented to the movement at manassas junction jackson was able to capture all of the supplies of the union army depot then he had his troops destroy all of it for it was the main depot for the union army jackson then retreated and then took up a defensive position and effectively invited pope to assault him on august 28–29 the start of the second battle of bull run second manassas pope launched repeated assaults against jackson as longstreet and the remainder of the army marched north to reach the battlefieldon august 30 pope came to believe that jackson was starting to retreat and longstreet took advantage of this by launching a massive assault on the union armys left with over 25000 men although the union troops put up a furious defense popes army was forced to retreat in a manner similar to the embarrassing union defeat at first bull run fought on roughly the same battlegroundwhen lee decided to invade the north in the maryland campaign jackson took harpers ferry then hastened to join the rest of the army at sharpsburg maryland where they fought mcclellan in the battle of antietam sharpsburg antietam was primarily a defensive battle against superior odds although mcclellan failed to exploit his advantage jacksons men bore the brunt of the initial attacks on the northern end of the battlefield and at the end of the day successfully resisted a breakthrough on the southern end when jacksons subordinate maj gen a p hill arrived at the last minute from harpers ferry the confederate forces held their position but the battle was extremely bloody for both sides and lee withdrew the army of northern virginia back across the potomac river ending the invasion on october 10 jackson was promoted to lieutenant general being ranked just behind lee and longstreet and his command was redesignated the second corpsbefore the armies camped for winter jacksons second corps held off a strong union assault against the right flank of the confederate line at the battle of fredericksburg in what became a confederate victory just before the battle jackson was delighted to receive a letter about the birth of his daughter julia laura jackson on november 23 also before the battle maj gen j e b stuart lees dashing and welldressed cavalry commander presented to jackson a fine generals frock coat that he had ordered from one of the best tailors in richmond jacksons previous coat was threadbare and colorless from exposure to the elements its buttons removed by admiring ladies jackson asked his staff to thank stuart saying that although the coat was too handsome for him he would cherish it as a souvenir his staff insisted that he wear it to dinner which caused scores of soldiers to rush to see him in uncharacteristic garb jackson was so embarrassed with the attention that he did not wear the new uniform for monthsat the battle of chancellorsville the army of northern virginia was faced with a serious threat by the army of the potomac and its new commanding general major general joseph hooker general lee decided to employ a risky tactic to take the initiative and offensive away from hookers new southern thrust – he decided to divide his forces jackson and his entire corps went on an aggressive flanking maneuver to the right of the union lines while riding with his infantry in a wide berth well south and west of the federal line of battle jackson employed maj gen fitzhugh lees cavalry to provide for better reconnaissance regarding the exact location of the union right and rear the results were far better than even jackson could have hoped fitzhugh lee found the entire right side of the federal lines in the middle of open field guarded merely by two guns that faced westward as well as the supplies and rear encampments the men were eating and playing games in carefree fashion completely unaware that an entire confederate corps was less than a mile away what happened next is given in fitzhugh lees own wordsso impressed was i with my discovery that i rode rapidly back to the point on the plank road where i had left my cavalry and back down the road jackson was moving until i met stonewall himself general said i if you will ride with me halting your column here out of sight i will show you the enemys right and you will perceive the great advantage of attacking down the old turnpike instead of the plank road the enemys lines being taken in reverse bring only one courier as you will be in view from the top of the hill jackson assented and i rapidly conducted him to the point of observation there had been no change in the picturei only knew jackson slightly i watched him closely as he gazed upon howards troops it was then about 2 pm his eyes burned with a brilliant glow lighting up a sad face his expression was one of intense interest his face was colored slightly with the paint of approaching battle and radiant at the success of his flank movement to the remarks made to him while the unconscious line of blue was pointed out he did not reply once during the five minutes he was on the hill and yet his lips were moving from what i have read and heard of jackson since that day i know now what he was doing then oh beware of rashness general hooker stonewall jackson is praying in full view and in rear of your right flank while talking to the great god of battles how could he hear what a poor cavalryman was saying tell general rodes said he suddenly whirling his horse towards the courier to move across the old plank road halt when he gets to the old turnpike and i will join him there one more look upon the federal lines and then he rode rapidly down the hill his arms flapping to the motion of his horse over whose head it seemed good rider as he was he would certainly go i expected to be told i had made a valuable personal reconnaissance—saving the lives of many soldiers and that jackson was indebted to me to that amount at least perhaps i might have been a little chagrined at jacksons silence and hence commented inwardly and adversely upon his horsemanship alas i had looked upon him for the last timejackson immediately returned to his corps and arranged his divisions into a line of battle to charge directly into the oblivious federal right the confederates marched silently until they were merely several hundred feet from the union position then released a cry and full charge many of the federal soldiers were captured without a shot fired the rest were driven into a full rout jackson pursued back toward the center of the federal line until duskas jackson and his staff were returning to camp on may 2 sentries of the 18th north carolina infantry regiment mistook the group for a union cavalry force the sentries shouted halt who goes there but fired before evaluating the reply frantic shouts by jacksons staff identifying the party were replied to by major john d barry with the retort its a damned yankee trick fire a second volley was fired in response jackson was hit by three bullets two in the left arm and one in the right hand several of jacksons men and many horses were killed in the attack incoming artillery rounds and darkness led to confusion and jackson was dropped from his stretcher while being evacuated hunter mcguire amputated jacksons left arm and jackson was moved to fairfield plantation at guinea station thomas chandler the owner offered the use of his home for jacksons treatment but jackson suggested using chandlers plantation office building insteadlee wrote to jackson after learning of his injuries stating could i have directed events i would have chosen for the good of the country to be disabled in your stead jackson died of complications from pneumonia on may 10 1863 eight days after he was shotdr mcguire wrote an account of jacksons final hours and last wordsa few moments before he died he cried out in his delirium order ap hill to prepare for action pass the infantry to the front rapidly tell major hawks— then stopped leaving the sentence unfinished presently a smile of ineffable sweetness spread itself over his pale face and he said quietly and with an expression as if of relief let us cross over the river and rest under the shade of the treesjacksons fatal bullet was withdrawn examined and found to be 67 caliber 067 inches 17 mm a type in service with the confederate forces union troops in the area were using 58 caliber balls this was one of the first instances of forensic ballistics identification derived from a firearm projectilehis body was moved to the governors mansion in richmond for the public to mourn and he was then moved to be buried in oak grove cemetery lexington virginia the arm that was amputated on may 2 was buried separately by jacksons chaplain beverly tucker lacy at the j horace lacy house ellwood now preserved at the fredericksburg national battlefield in the wilderness of orange county near the field hospitalupon hearing of jacksons death robert e lee mourned the loss of both a friend and a trusted commander as jackson lay dying lee sent a message through chaplain lacy saying give general jackson my affectionate regards and say to him he has lost his left arm but i my right the night lee learned of jacksons death he told his cook william i have lost my right arm and im bleeding at the heartharpers weekly reported jacksons death on may 23 1863 as followsdeath of stonewall jacksonjacksons sometimes unusual command style and personality traits combined with his frequent success in battle contribute to his legacy as one of the greatest generals of the civil war he was martial and stern in attitude and profoundly religious a deacon in the presbyterian church one of his many nicknames was old blue lights a term applied to a military man whose evangelical zeal burned with the intensity of the blue light used for nighttime displayjackson held a lifelong belief that one of his arms was longer than the other and thus usually held the longer arm up to equalize his circulation he was described as a champion sleeper and occasionally even fell asleep with food in his mouth jackson suffered a number of ailments for which he sought relief via contemporary practices of his day including hydrotherapy popular in america at that time visiting establishments at oswego new york 1850 and round hill massachusetts 1860 although with little evidence of success jackson also suffered a significant hearing loss in both of his ears as a result of his prior service in the us army as an artillery officera recurring story concerns jacksons love of lemons which he allegedly gnawed whole to alleviate symptoms of dyspepsia indigestion general richard taylor son of president zachary taylor wrote a passage in his war memoirs about jackson eating lemons where jackson got his lemons no fellow could find out but he was rarely without one however recent research by his biographer james i robertson jr has found that none of jacksons contemporaries including members of his staff his friends or his wife recorded any unusual obsessions with lemons jackson thought of a lemon as a rare treat enjoyed greatly whenever it could be obtained from the enemys camp jackson was fond of all fruits particularly peaches but he enjoyed with relish lemons oranges watermelons apples grapes berries or whatever was availablejacksons religion has often been discussed his biographer robert lewis dabney suggested that it was the fear of god which made him so fearless of all else jackson himself had said my religious belief teaches me to feel as safe in battle as in bedstephen w sears states that jackson was fanatical in his presbyterian faith and it energized his military thought and character theology was the only subject he genuinely enjoyed discussing his dispatches invariably credited an everkind providence according to sears this fanatical religiosity had drawbacks it warped jacksons judgment of men leading to poor appointments it was said he preferred good presbyterians to good soldiers james i robertson jr suggests that jackson was a christian soldier in every sense of the word according to robertson jackson thought of the war as a religious crusade and viewed himself as an old testament warrior—like david or joshua—who went into battle to slay the philistinesjackson encouraged the confederate states army revival that occurred in 1863 although it was probably more of a grassroots movement than a topdown revival jackson strictly observed the sunday sabbath james i robertson jr notes that no place existed in his sunday schedule for labor newspapers or secular conversationin command jackson was extremely secretive about his plans and extremely meticulous about military discipline this secretive nature did not stand him in good stead with his subordinates who were often not aware of his overall operational intentions until the last minute and who complained of being left out of key decisionsrobert e lee could trust jackson with deliberately undetailed orders that conveyed lees overall objectives what modern doctrine calls the end state this was because jackson had a talent for understanding lees sometimes unstated goals and lee trusted jackson with the ability to take whatever actions were necessary to implement his end state requirements few of lees subsequent corps commanders had this ability at gettysburg this resulted in lost opportunities with a defeated and disorganized union army trying to regroup on high ground near town and vulnerable lee sent one of his new corps commanders richard s ewell discretionary orders that the heights cemetery hill and culps hill be taken if practicable without jacksons intuitive grasp of lees orders or the instinct to take advantage of sudden tactical opportunities ewell chose not to attempt the assault and this failure is considered by historians to be the greatest missed opportunity of the battlejackson had a poor reputation as a horseman one of his soldiers georgia volunteer william andrews wrote that jackson was a very ordinary looking man of medium size his uniform badly soiled as though it had seen hard service he wore a cap pulled down nearly to his nose and was riding a rawboned horse that did not look much like a charger unless it would be on hay or clover he certainly made a poor figure on a horseback with his stirrup leather six inches too short putting his knees nearly level with his horses back and his heels turned out with his toes sticking behind his horses foreshoulder a sorry description of our most famous general but a correct one his horse was named little sorrel also known as old sorrel a small chestnut gelding which was a captured union horse from a connecticut farm he rode little sorrel throughout the war and was riding him when he was shot at chancellorsville little sorrel died at age 36 and is buried near a statue of jackson on the parade grounds of vmi his mounted hide is on display in the vmi museumafter the war jacksons wife and young daughter julia moved from lexington to north carolina mary anna jackson wrote two books about her husbands life including some of his letters she never remarried and was known as the widow of the confederacy living until 1915 his daughter julia married and bore children but she died of typhoid fever at the age of 26 yearsmany theorists through the years have postulated that if jackson had lived lee might have prevailed at gettysburg certainly jacksons discipline and tactical sense were sorely missedas a boy general george patton of world war ii fame prayed next to two portraits of robert e lee and stonewall jackson whom he assumed were god and jesus he once told dwight d eisenhower i will be your jackson general douglas macarthur called
