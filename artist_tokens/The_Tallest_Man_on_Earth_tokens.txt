bad writing for no depression john amen concluded that while matsson ’ s latest set occasionally loses traction it certainly includes its memorable moments most of which reiterate the confessional pitch and rougher vocal stylings of his earlier workcritics have compared the tallest man on earth to bob dylan both in terms of songwriting ability and vocal style when asked about his lyrical style matsson explains that he began listening to bob dylan at fifteen and upon hearing dylans cover material he tried to figure out where those songs came from and became slowly exposed to early american folk such as pete seeger and woody guthrie but he is careful to qualify this saying i dont consider my work to be a part of any tradition this is how i play this is how i write songswith regard to his guitar technique matsson uses a variety of open tunings and standard tuning to a lesser degree he had classical guitar training in his youth but says he never really focused on it and that by the end of high school he got bored playing guitar because it was like math until he then discovered open tunings while listening to nick drake in his early twenties he was drawn to this style of playing because it allowed him to focus on singing while still performing intricate music
