from their native nashville tennessee in 1959 duane and gregg became friends with a black youth named floyd miles and the three began to spend their time at local rhythm blues clubs where they participated in jam sessions with some of the bands miles later remembered gregg was a longhaired musician so back then he was a freak and im black so we both knew what it was like to be discriminated against which is probably why we got along so well we had each other and we had the music the brothers formed and performed in several local rock bands such as the escorts and the allman joys by 1967 the group was performing in st louis where a los angelesbased recording executive discovered them they consequently moved out west and were renamed the hour glass releasing two unsuccessful albums for liberty records duane moved back to pursue a career as a session musician in muscle shoals alabama while gregg stayed in los angeles bound by contractual obligations with liberty who believed he could hold a solo career the two were apart for the first time for a year but reconvened in miami producing an albumlength demo with the 31st of february a group that included drummer butch trucksat fame

oakley to jam with the new group the pair had met in a macon georgia club some time earlier and became quick friends the group had immediate chemistry and duanes vision for a different band one with two lead guitarists and two drummers began to come to fruition meanwhile phil walden who managed otis redding and several other rb acts was looking to expand into rock acts fame owner rick hall became frustrated with the groups recording methods and offered the tracks recorded and their contract to walden and jerry wexler of atlantic records who purchased them for 10000 walden intended the upcoming group to be the centerpiece of his new atlanticdistributed label capricornduane and jaimoe moved to jacksonville florida in early march 1969 as duane had become frustrated with being a robot of those at fame he invited anyone who wanted to join to the jam sessions that birthed the allman brothers band dickey betts leader of oakleys previous band the second coming became the groups second lead guitarist while butch trucks with whom duane and gregg had cut a demo less than a year prior became the new groups second drummer the second comings reese wynans played keyboards and duane oakley and betts all shared vocal duties the unnamed group began to perform free shows in willow branch park in jacksonville with an everchanging rotating cast of musicians duane felt strongly his brother should be the vocalist of the new group which effectively eliminated wynanss position as gregg also played keyboards gregg left los angeles and entered rehearsal on march 26 1969 when the group was rehearsing muddy waters trouble no more although gregg was initially intimidated by the musicians duane pressured his brother into singing guts out four days later the group made their debut at the jacksonville armory although many potential band names were kicked around including beelzebub the sixpiece eventually decided on the allman brothers bandthe group moved to macon georgia by may 1 where walden was establishing capricorn records kim payne mike callahan and joseph red dog campbell became the bands early crew members red dog was a disabled vietnam veteran who donated his monthly disability checks to the bands cause in macon the group stayed at friend twiggs lyndons apartment on 309 college street which became known as the communal home of the band and crew nicknamed the hippie crash pad there were five or six occupied apartments in the building with the hippie crash pad and you would expect they would call the police on us because we were constantly raising hell at three or four in the morning but they all just moved out said trucks living meagerly they found a friend in mama louise hudson cook and proprietor of the hh soul food restaurant who ran a tab when they were short of funds early on made good with proceeds from duanes recording sessions on the side the bands image was radical in the just barely integrated macon a lot of the white folk around here did not approve of them longhaired boys or of them always having a black guy with them said hudson the band performed locally as well as 80 miles north in atlantas piedmont park and practiced at the newly minted capricorn nearly each daythe group forged a strong brotherhood spending countless hours rehearsing consuming psychedelic drugs and hanging out in rose hill cemetery where they wrote songs their first performances outside the south came on may 30 and 31 in boston opening for the velvet underground in need of more material the group remade old blues numbers such as trouble no more and one way out in addition to improvised jams such as mountain jam gregg who had struggled to write in the past became the bands sole songwriter composing songs such as whipping post and blackhearted woman the band was originally set to record their first album in miami with producer tom dowd who had worked with cream and john coltrane but dowd proved to be unavailable instead they headed off for new york city in august 1969 to work with atlantic house engineer adrian barber in his first producer credit the allman brothers band was recorded and mixed in two weeks and proved a positive experience for the ensemble new york came to be regarded within the group as their second home the allman brothers band was released in november 1969 through atco and capricorn records but received a poor commercial response selling less than 35000 copies upon initial releaseexecutives suggested to walden that he relocate the band to new york or los angeles to acclimate them to the industry they wanted us to act like a rock band and we just told them to fuck themselves remembered trucks for their part the members of the band remained optimistic electing to stay in the south everyone told us wed fall by the wayside down there said gregg allman but the collaboration between the band and capricorn records transformed macon from this sleepy little town into a very hip wild and crazy place filled with bikers and rockers the band rented a 165amonth farmhouse on a lake outside of macon the busy comings and goings at which reminded them of new york citys idlewild airport idlewild south was the home of rehearsals and parties and was where the brotherhood came to pass according to roadie kim payne there was a pact made out there around a campfire—all for one and one for all everybody believed 100 percent much of the material presented on the bands second album idlewild south originated at the cabin oakleys wife rented a large tudor revival home on 2321 vineville avenue in macon and the band moved into what they dubbed the big house in march 1970the band played continuously in 1970 performing over 300 dates on the road traveling in a ford econoline van and later a winnebago nicknamed the wind bag walden doubted the bands future worrying whether they would ever catch on but word of mouth spread due to the bands relentless touring schedule and crowds got larger the close proximity of the winnebago brought about heavy drug use within the group and all in the group with the exception of the brothers were struggling to make a living in one instance touring manager twiggs lyndon stabbed and killed a promoter for not paying the band he later cited temporary insanity later that year duane accidentally overdosed on opium after a show the bands sophomore album idlewild south produced by tom dowd was recorded gradually over a period of five months in various cities including new york miami and macon and contained two of the bands bestknown songs midnight rider later a hit for various artists including a top 20 solo effort by gregg and in memory of elizabeth reed which became one of the bands famous concert numbersidlewild south was issued by atco and capricorn records in september 1970 less than a year after their debut the album sold only marginally better than its predecessor though the band had a growing national reputation and the album included songs that would become staples of the bands repertoire—and eventually of rock radio shortly after completing recording dowd put duane in contact with guitarist eric clapton who invited him to contribute to his new project derek and the dominos allman was a huge fan of claptons work with cream and clapton had been blown away by allmans session work on wilson picketts hey jude some years prior they met after a show one night in miami and jammed together until the next afternoon with the two guitarists regarding one another as instant soulmates clapton invited duane to join derek and the dominos and by several accounts he considered it in the end he declined the offer and rejoined the allman brothers band returning after missing a string of several shows the sessions were collected on layla and other assorted love songs issued that novembertheir fortunes began to change over the course of 1971 when the bands average earnings doubled we realized that the audience was a big part of what we did which couldnt be duplicated in a studio a lightbulb finally went off we needed to make a live album said gregg allman the resulting live album at fillmore east was recorded over three nights—march 11 12 and 13 1971—at the fillmore east in new york for which the band was paid a nightly 1250 at fillmore east was released in july 1971 by capricorn records as a double album peoplepriced for the cost of a single lp while previous albums by the band had taken months to hit the charts often near the bottom of the top 200 the record started to climb the charts after a matter of days at fillmore east peaked at number 13 on billboards top pop albums chart and was certified gold by the recording industry association of america that october becoming their commercial and artistic breakthrough the album is considered among the best live albums of all time and in 2004 was one of the albums selected for preservation in the library of congress deemed culturally historically or aesthetically significant by the national recording registryalthough at fillmore east brought the band more success and wealth than ever before many of the band and its entourage were struggling with heroin addiction four individuals—group leader duane allman bassist berry oakley and roadies robert payne and red dog campbell—checked into the linwoodbryant hospital for rehabilitation in october 1971 on october 29 1971 duane allman then 24 was killed in a motorcycle accident one day after returning to macon allman was riding his motorcycle at a high speed at the intersection of hillcrest avenue and bartlett street as a flatbed truck carrying a lumber crane approached the truck stopped suddenly in the intersection forcing allman to swerve his harleydavidson sportster motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision as he was doing so he struck either the back of the truck or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from the motorcycle the motorcycle bounced into the air landed on allman and skidded another 90 feet with allman pinned underneath crushing his internal organs though he was alive when he arrived at the hospital despite immediate emergency surgery he died several hours later from massive internal injuriesafter duanes death the band held a meeting on their future clearly all wanted to continue and after a short period the band returned to the road we all had this thing in us and duane put it there he was the teacher and he gave something to us—his disciples—that we had to play out said drummer butch trucks the band returned to miami in december to complete work on their third studio album eat a peach completing its recording raised each members spirits the music brought life back to us all and it was simultaneously realized by every one of us we found strength vitality newness reason and belonging as we worked on finishing eat a peach said allman those last three songs just kinda floated right on out of us the music was still good it was still rich and it still had that energy—it was still the allman brothers band released in february 1972 eat a peach was the bands second hit album shipping gold and peaking at number four on billboards top 200 pop albums chart wed been through hell but somehow we were rolling bigger than ever said gregg allmanthe band performed nearly 90 shows in the following year touring as a fivepiece the band also purchased 432 acres of land in juliette georgia for 160000 and nicknamed it the farm it soon became a group hangout and fulfilled bassist oakleys communal dreams oakley however was visibly suffering from the death of his friend he drank excessively heavily consumed drugs and was losing weight quickly according to friends and family he appeared to have lost all hope his heart his drive his ambition his direction following duanes death everything berry had envisioned for everybody—including the crew the women and children—was shattered on the day duane died and he didnt care after that said roadie kim payne oakley repeatedly wished to get high be high and stay high causing quiet concern from all those around him on november 11 1972 slightly inebriated and overjoyed at the prospect of leading a jam session later that night oakley crashed his motorcycle into the side of a bus just three blocks from where duane had been killed he declined hospital treatment and went home but gradually grew delirious he was taken to the hospital shortly thereafter and died of cerebral swelling caused by a fractured skull oakley was buried directly beside duane at rose hill cemetery in maconthe band unanimously decided to carry on and arranged auditions for new bassists with a renewed fervor and determination several bassists auditioned and the band eventually chose lamar williams an old friend of drummer jai johanny johansons from gulfport mississippi two years removed from an army stint in vietnam chuck leavell was asked to play piano for allmans solo album laid back 1973 and gradually found himself contributing to the allman brothers as well dickey betts became the groups de facto leader during the recording process its not like dickey came in and said im taking over im the boss do this and that it wasnt overt it was still supposedly a democracy but dickey started doing more and more of the songwriting said road manager willie perkins the bands fourth studio album brothers and sisters was released in august 1973 and became their biggest success yet peaking at number one and resulting in the band being considered the most popular band in the country ramblin man betts countryinfused number received interest from radio stations immediately and it rose to number two on the billboard hot 100the allman brothers band returned to touring playing larger venues receiving more profit and dealing with less friendship miscommunication and spiraling drug problems this culminated in a backstage brawl when the band played with the grateful dead at washingtons rfk stadium in june 1973 which resulted in the firing of three of the bands longtime roadies the band played arenas and stadiums almost solely as their drug use escalated in 1974 the band was regularly making 100000 per show and was renting the starship a customized boeing 720b used by led zeppelin and the rolling stones when got that goddamn plane it was the beginning of the end said allman both allman and betts released top20 solo albums in 1974 the gregg allman tour and highway callin july 1974 the band visited europe for the first time they had planned to tour britain and europe at the beginning of that year but the 197374 energy crisis forced a lastminute postponement they headlined 2 big outdoor events one the summerconcert 74 at the sportpark hilversum the netherlands on july 18 attended by 20000 spectators and the second one at bucolic frolic the first knebworth park festival on july 20 where they played a wellreceived threehour twoset performance in front of 70000 fans from all over europethe sessions that produced 1975s win lose or draw the last album by the original allman brothers band were disjointed and inconsistent gregg allman was largely living in los angeles and dating pop star cher and was according to biographer alan paul more famous for being famous than for his music his vocals were recorded there as he could not be bothered to return to macon upon its release it was considered subpar and sold less than its predecessor the band later remarked that they were embarrassed about the albumfrom august 1975 to may 1976 the allman brothers band played 41 shows to some of the biggest crowds of their career gradually the members of the band grew apart during these tours with sound checks and rehearsals a thing of the past allman later pointed to a benefit for presidential candidate jimmy carter an avowed fan of the group as the only real high point in an otherwise rough rough tour the shows were considered lackluster and the members were excessive in their drug use the breaking point came when gregg allman testified in the trial of security man scooter herring bandmates considered him a snitch and he received death threats leading to lawenforcement protection herring was convicted on five counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and received a 75year prison sentence which was later reduced prior to a presidential pardon from carter for his part allman always maintained that herring had told him to take the deal to turn states evidence and that he herring would take the fall nevertheless the band refused to communicate with allman after the incident as a result the band finally broke up leavell williams and jaimoe continued playing together in sea level betts formed great southern and allman founded the gregg allman band the 1976 live album wipe the windows check the oil dollar gas was seen as the last gasp of a dying band this was unfortunate for the nowfloundering capricorn records as the label was relying on the band staying together to stay financially afloatin 1978 allman and walden first approached betts with the idea of a reunion their first public appearance together came at a great southern show in new yorks central park that summer when allman trucks and jaimoe joined the band for a few songs williams and leavell declined to leave sea level so the allman brothers band hired guitarist dan toler and bassist david goldflies from great southern the band reunited with tom dowd at criteria studios in miami to cut their reunion album which was released in february 1979 as enlightened rogues a term duane had used to describe the band while the band tried to make it happen they later concluded that the chemistry was not there the album was a minor commercial success which was credited to the production work from dowd betts filed a lawsuit against walden for nonpayment of record and publishing royalties and bettss lawyer steve massarsky began managing the group betts won the lawsuit and the rest of the band filed suit while capricorn declared bankruptcy that october massarsky led the successful effort to sign the band with arista which pushed the band to modernize their sound clive davis destroyed any hope that we had that we could make the thing work again said trucks later he wanted us to be a southern american version of led zeppelin and brought in outside producers and it just kept getting worsetheir first arista effort reach for the sky 1980 was produced by nashville songwriters mike lawler and johnny cobb bonnie bramlett who toured with the band near the end of the decade sang lead on one song lawler soon became a part of the bands touring ensemble incorporating centerstage keytar solos that most fans consider the bands nadir drugs remained a problem with the band particularly among betts and allman although the album was made with the intention of creating a hit single the genre of southern rock was waning considerably in the mainstream the band again grew apart firing longtime roadie red dog and replacing jaimoe with tolers brother frankie who had been a member of great southern the main point of contention was jaimoes insistence that his wife and manager candace oakley berrys sister handle his business affairs one of the real blights on the history of the allman brothers band was that jaimoe this gentle man was fired from this organization said allman later not long after the band changed managers hiring the promoter john scher after massarsky eased himself out reportedly saying its a milliondollar headache and a quartermilliondollar jobfor their second and final album with arista brothers of the road 1981 they collaborated with a name producer john ryan of styx and the doobie brothers who pushed the band even harder to change their sound straight from the heart was the albums single which became a minor hit but heralded the groups last appearance on the top 40 charts the band considering their postreunion albums embarrassing subsequently broke up in 1982 after clashing with clive davis who rejected every producer the band suggested for a possible third album including tom dowd and johnny sandlin we broke up in 82 because we decided we better just back out or we would ruin what was left of the bands image said betts the bands final performance came on saturday night live in january 1982 where they performed southbound and leavin the members regrouped occasionally in the intervening years in 1986 betts and allman toured together with each opening for one another and collaborating for a set the full allman brothers bandallman betts trucks jaimoe leavell and dan toleralso reunited twice in 1986 for the volunteers jam and crackdown on crack concerts allmans solo career began looking up when he released his first solo album in over a decade in 1987 im no angel the title track became a surprise hit on radio peaking at no 49 on the billboard hot 100 and no 1 on the magazines mainstream rock tracks chartthe allman brothers band celebrated its twentieth anniversary in 1989 and the band reunited for a summer tour with jaimoe once again on drums in addition they featured guitarist warren haynes and pianist johnny neel both from the dickey betts band and bassist allen woody who was hired after open auditions held at trucks florida studio the classic rock radio format had given the bands catalog songs new relevance as did a multicd retrospective box set dreams epic who had worked with allman on his solo career signed the band danny goldberg became the bands manager he had previously worked with acts such as led zeppelin and bonnie raitt the group were initially reluctant to tour but found they performed solidly in addition former roadies such as red dog returned the band returned to the studio with longtime producer tom dowd for 1990s seven turns which was considered a return to form good clean fun and seven turns each became big hits on the mainstream rock tracks chart the addition of haynes and woody had reenergized the ensemble neel left the group in 1990 and the band added percussionist marc quiñones formerly of spyro gyra the following yearthe band performed 87 shows in 1991 and 77 the following year the band did not renew goldbergs contract as manager and as a result their tour manager bert holman became the bands fulltime manager in 1991 and remained so for the rest of their career their next studio effort shades of two worlds 1992 produced the crowd favorite nobody knows the band also released a live album an evening with the allman brothers band first set recorded at their 1992 residency at new yorks beacon theatre the band performed ten consecutive shows there establishing themselves as a new york rite of spring according to biographer alan paul which set the stage for their return nearly every year afterward the band grew contentious over a 1993 tour in which betts was arrested when he shoved two police officers struggling to find a replacement guitarist they brought in david grissom then touring with john mellencamp and also jack pearson a nashvillebased friend of haynes the original replacement zakk wylde filled in for a show but his onstage antics did not fit with the band haynes was both opening with his own band and headlining with the allman brothers and began to consider leaving the group due to their increasing lack of communicationdespite the growing tension haynes remained a member and betts returned their third postreunion record where it all begins 1994 was recorded entirely live on a film soundstage without an audience the allman brothers was a yearbyyear thing there was no indication that it was capable of staying together for years to come we all looked at it as each tour could be the last one and there was no reason to think otherwise said haynes the band continued to tour with greater frequency attracting younger generations with their headlining of the horde festival the group were inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in january 1995 allman was severely inebriated and could not make it through his acceptance speech seeing the ceremony broadcast on television later allman was mortified providing a catalyst for his final successful attempt to quit alcohol and substance abuse during the 1996 run at the beacon turmoil came to a breaking point between allman and betts nearly causing a cancellation of a show and causing another band breakup we were upstairs in our dressing rooms im sitting there thinking this is it this is how it finally ends said trucks haynes and woody left to focus on govt mule feeling as though a break was imminent with the allman brothers bandthe group recruited oteil burbridge of the aquarium rescue unit to replace woody on bass and jack pearson on guitar concerns arose over the increasing loudness of allman brothers shows which were largely centered on betts pearson struggling with tinnitus left as a result following the 1999 beacon run trucks phoned his nephew derek trucks to join the band for their thirtieth anniversary tour trucks was very young at age 20 and younger than any of the original members when the band formed it was an honor to be part of such a great institution from the start said derek trucks when i first got the gig i was just trying to maintain the spirit of the whole thing while hopefully bringing some fire to it hoping to hold up my end while also expressing my own voice the beacon run in 2000 captured on peakin at the beacon was ironically considered among the bands worst performances an eightshow spring tour led to even more strained relations in the group it had ceased to be a band—everything had to be based around what dickey was playing said allman anger boiled over within the group towards betts which led to all original members sending him a letter informing him of their intentions to tour without him for the summerall involved contend that the break was temporary but betts responded by hiring a lawyer and suing the group which led to a permanent divorce i had no idea that i would be snapped out of the picture i thought it was cruel and impersonal said betts allman was finally sober and felt that more miserable shows with betts would be a waste of time betts later received a cash settlement which is subject to a confidentiality agreement he went on to record new music with a new band jimmy herring joined the band for the summer tour where the band fought negative press fans contended that attending shows by an allman brothers band without betts was pointless herring exited shortly after the tour as he felt guilty that he would replace betts that august former bassist allen woody was found dead in a hotel room in new york warren haynes set up a benefit show for his former bandmate which featured the allman brothers band with derek trucks unavailable he sat in for the set in 2001 haynes rejoined the band for their beacon run it was my first time with the band in four years and it was very comfortable he remarkedthis incarnation of the allman brothers band was wellregarded among fans and the general public and remained stable and productive this band is the greatest one since duane and berry and why shouldnt it be said jaimoe the band released their final studio recording hittin the note 2003 to critical acclaim the record was the first to feature derek trucks and the only allman brothers album to not feature betts the band continued to tour throughout the 2000s remaining a top touring act regularly attracting more than 20000 fans the decade closed with a successful run at the beacon theatre in celebration of the bands fortieth anniversary that was the most fun ive ever had in that building said allman and it was universally regarded within the band as a career highlight the run featured numerous special guests including eric clapton whom all in the band regarded as the most special guest due to his association with duane allman had a liver transplant in 2010 and suffered health setbacks for the following two years he went to rehab in 2012 for addiction following his medical treatmentsdavid frankie toler died at a hospice care in bradenton florida on june 4 2011 after a long illness following a liver transplant at the age of 59in 2012 the allman brothers started their own music festival the peach which features many associated acts and many genres in addition to two allman brothers performances they played a run at the beacon in 2013 per tradition and after continued to tour in 2014 haynes and derek trucks announced their intention to depart the group at the end of the year the group intended their 2014 run of beacon shows to be their last but the residency was cut short when allman developed bronchitis however in september 2014 the group played the iconic at fillmore east album at the lockn music festival in arrington virginiain early 2014 warren haynes and derek trucks announced that they would be leaving the band at the end of the year and the group decided to retire from touring gregg allman stated this is it—this is the end of it fortyfive years is enough and i want to do something else anyway the allman brothers band performed its final show on october 28 2014 at the beacon theatre the show was the 238th straight sellout for the band at the beacon the concert consisted of three sets comprising mostly music from their first five records with no guest musicians sitting in we had a band meeting and decided no guest sitins were going out with just the band allman told reporters following the sets which ran into the early morning hours the band joined center stage and took a bow with allman recalling the groups first rehearsal 45 years prior i was called to come and meet these guys in jacksonville florida on march 26 1969 now were gon na do the first song we ever played following this the band performed trouble no more by muddy waters during the nights intermissions a video screen displayed a message the road indeed goes on forever so stay calm eat a peach and carry onin january 2017 founding member butch trucks died from a selfinflicted gunshot wound that may founding member gregg allman died from complications arising from liver cancer at the age of 69 putting an end to any possibilities of a reunionin january 2020 the five surviving members of the final allman brothers lineup calling themselves the brothers announced their intentions to hold a show to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the band on march 10 at madison square garden the concert lasted over four hours with duane trucks taking the place of his uncle on drums protoallmans member reese wynans taking the place of gregg allman on organ and warren haynes taking on gregg allmans vocal parts in addition pianist and past member chuck leavell joined the band for about half the numbers played dickey betts was invited to participate but his health precluded him from traveling although he wished the event be successful like the final beacon show the brothers 50 concert was dominated by material from the groups first five albums the show was one of the last large concerts to take place before the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in north america forced the shutdown of such events some people accordingly did not go to it and indeed especially due to the older demographic of the groups fan base derek trucks would subsequently wonder whether it had been wise to move forward with itfollowing the death of dickey betts on april 18 2024 drummer jaimoe became the last surviving original member of the allman brothers bandthe allman brothers band have generally been considered one of the pioneering bands in southern rock although the group distanced itself from the term guitarist dickey betts was most vocal about this classification which he considered unfair i think its limiting id rather just be known as a progressive rock band from the south im damned proud of who i am and where im from but i hate the term southern rock i think calling us that pigeonholed us and forced people to expect certain types of music from us that i dont think are fairgregg allman also saw the southern rock tag as redundant saying it was like saying rock rock due to rock and roll being born in the south the band was certainly at the forefront of the genres popularity in the early 1970s the breakthrough of at fillmore east led their hometown of macon to become flooded with southern rock groups despite this the group has continued to remove itself from the term the problem i have is a lot of people associate it with rednecks and rebel flags and backward mentality that has never been representative of the allman brothers band said guitarist warren haynesthe group largely infused hints of the blues jazz and country into their music they all avidly shared their record collections with one another during the early days of the band for example betts was into country music and the guitar work of chuck berry while trucks was largely into groups such as the rolling stones and the grateful dead duane and gregg allman grew infatuated with rhythm and blues in their teens collecting records by james brown bb king sonny boy williamson and howlin wolf the brothers were also heavily influenced by guitarist taj mahal and his 1968 eponymous debut album it was this influence that led both to their discovery of their now famous slide guitar style drummer jai johanny jaimoe johanson largely introduced the group to jazz while betts commented that he was interested in artists such as howard roberts prior jaimoe really fired us up on it introducing his bandmates to miles davis and john coltrane duane allman was also inspired by howard roberts wes montgomery tal farlow and kenny burrell the source of the bands modal jamming in their earliest days was coltranes rendition of my favorite things and davis all blues which jaimoe occasionally stole from i did a lot of copying but only from the best this type of jazzinfused jamming is expressed in the instrumental in memory of elizabeth reed which focuses heavily on improvisation whipping post was notable for its inclusion of bluesballad themes and became one of the most popular and longest compositions later betts generally led the band in a more country direction following duanes passing their only hit single ramblin man was considered so unusually country for the group that they were initially reluctant to record itduane allman had the idea of having two lead guitarists which was inspired by curtis mayfield wanted the bass keyboards and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping said allman their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians the pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques often forming intricate interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist berry oakley setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies dickey betts playing was very melodybased my style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight because im such a melody guy that even when im playing the blues i go for melody first he said his listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably i played mandolin ukulele and fiddle before i ever touched a guitar which may be where a lot of the major keys i play come from he later characterized their style as question and answer anticipation and conclusion which involved allowing each musicians downbeat to arrive in a different spot while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines the group also held an improvisational approach to live performances which connected the band with jam band culture jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades but i think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music said haynes we sure didnt set out to be a jam band but those long jams just emanated from within the band because we didnt want to just play three minutes and be over said allman rolling stone referred to the group as without question the first great jam band and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reachedthe allman brothers band were considerably influential within the southern united states their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable southern rock bands—among those lynyrd skynyrd the marshall tucker band and wet willie—to achieve commercial success and also almost singlehandedly made capricorn records into a major independent label billy gibbons of zz top writing for rolling stone wrote that the group defined the best of every music from the american south in that time they were the best of all of us he went on to call the band a true brotherhood of players—one that went beyond race and ego it was a thing of beauty the bands extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans one that viewed the allmans as pioneers of latterday collegiate jam rockallmusic praised the bands
