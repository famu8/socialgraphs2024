heaven and a dixie night before disbanding again pirates of the mississippi are known for a country rock sound and they received significant media attention for sociopolitical messages in some of their songsbill mccorvey founder of pirates of the mississippi had moved from montgomery alabama to nashville tennessee in the 1980s with the intent of pursuing a career in country music when he was initially unable to do so he supported himself financially by working various jobs these included building houses and filling envelopes in a warehouse while doing so he befriended rich alves and the two began writing songs together their original intent was to provide uptempo material for conway twitty to record but most of this material was not selected by him because of this mccorvey and alves decided to recruit other musicians to form a band and play the songs themselves mccorvey served as lead vocalist with alves on lead guitar and backing vocals completing the original lineup were steel guitar and dobro player pat severs bass guitarist and backing vocalist dean townson and drummer jimmy lowe the five members began performing together in 1987 severs had played in eddie rabbitts band before becoming a session musician lowe was a computer programmer and townson worked at an aviation factory the five of them began rehearsing in lowes basement at night and decided to pursue a fulltime career as a band after noting that neighbors would come over and listen to their music they began performing at various events across the southeastern united states the band originally took the name the cloggers after they were entertained by a group of dancers wearing clogs at a gig in smyrna georgiathe cloggers were discovered in the late 1980s by an artists and repertoire ar agent for universal records then a new record label owned by record producer jimmy bowen executives at the label disliked the bands name and suggested that they change it they chose the name pirates of the mississippi after a song they had written about lowe whom they thought resembled a pirate the bands debut album was finished by 1988 but its release was delayed until 1990 due to universal being bought out by capitol records nashville division in the meantime alves cowrote the singles time in by the oak ridge boys and southern star by alabama the latter of which went to number one on the billboard hot country songs charts in early 1990 17â€“18 he and mccorvey also cowrote karma road for the group traderprice who were also signed to capitol by way of the universal merger on their 1990 debut albumin june 1990 after the merger of universal was completed capitol released the bands selftitled debut album alves produced the album with james stroud pirates of the mississippi produced four chart singles on the billboard country charts between 1990 and 1991 the first single selected was a cover of hank williams honky tonk blues 282 according to mccorvey the cover of honky tonk blues was not originally intended to be on the album but was added because label executives thought the other songs on the album were not strong enough to serve as a lead single the band members chose honky tonk blues because it was the first song they had performed together upon release this song peaked at number 26 on the country charts 282 although the followup rollin home peaked outside the top 40 the albums third single feed jake became the bands biggest hit at number 15 282 the song received a music video directed by deatonflanigen productions this was one of the first country music videos not to show the artist in it at all feed jake was the bands most popular song with fans and was described in 1993 as their signature song speak of the devil the last single from pirates of the mississippi also made the country top 40 282 pirates of the mississippi accounted for two awards for the band these were top new group from radio records in 1990 and top new vocal group award from the academy of country music a year later brian mansfield wrote in allmusic that the album is a cross between alabama country and southern rockthere are a few twists though namely a guy clark songand a surfcountry instrumental pirates of the mississippi was certified gold by the canadian recording industry association now known as music canada in 1993 a certification which at the time honored shipments of 50000 copies in the united states the album sold over 370000 copies1991s walk the plank was the bands second album alves continued to produce doing so with bowen this time lead single fighting for you peaked at number 41 on the country charts upon release 282 according to robert k oermann of the tennessean this was due to radio programmers considering the song too downbeat followup singles til im holding you again and too much the latter written by guy clark and lee roy parnell were minor chart hits 282 between the bands first two albums the members performed all instruments themselves except for the synthesized strings on feed jake and fighting for you these were performed by john kelton also the sound engineer on those albums mccorvey thought the songs on walk the plank were stronger than those on the first album and that the production was closer to the sound of the bands concerts mansfield said of walk the plank that the allman brothers cops are more exciting than their stonecountry material although thats certainly competent enough he also thought that til im holding you again showed influences of soul music alanna nash of entertainment weekly praised the bands sense of humor but thought that the albums sounds and influences were inconsistentafter a restructuring of capitol nashville pirates of the mississippi were transferred to liberty records where they would release their third album a street man named desire in 1992 the title track charted at number 56 on the country charts that same year 282 members of the band told the regina leaderpost that they received calls from representatives of bill clinton the democratic party nominee for president of the united states in the thenupcoming 1992 united states presidential election said representatives wanted the band to endorse clinton because they thought the songs lyrics would be appealing to his constituency severs refused as he knew that the band members had differing political viewpoints from each other and did not want to involve the band in political matters conversely the song received negative attention from representatives of the republican party severs stated that an unnamed radio station in a larger market was playing the song regularly but withdrew it from rotation after a close personal friend of president george h w bush called the station and asked them to do so the only other single from the album was dont quit your day job a song about the bands attempts to combine their music careers with their commercial jobs in their early years jack hurst of tribune media wrote that the band possess a swingy earfriendliness as well as a gift for the occasional stunning lyric after this album severs injured his back when a light display fell on him during a concertdream you was the bands next album for liberty released in 1993 lowe and alves told the tennessean that the band wanted to have a more mainstream sound due to the failures of fighting for you and a street man named desire the album included a cover of hank thompsons 1952 single the wild side of life mark wright produced the album and cowrote two tracks on it unlike their previous albums it included a number of outside writers such as roger murrah craig wiseman dickey lee and robert ellis orrall the only charted single off dream you was its title track which reached number 63 and accounted for the bands final appearance on the hot country songs charts 282 save the wild life was also a single but it did not chart an uncredited article in the victorville california daily press praised the album for its use of steel guitar as well as the variety of writers mansfield called it basically a party album despite the critical reception the album was commercially unsuccessful the editors of country music the encyclopedia attributed this to the large amount of new musicians on the scene at the time drawing attention away from the band because of the albums failure liberty dropped pirates of the mississippi in 1994 after releasing a greatesthits package titled the best of pirates of the mississippi pat severs quit the band in mid1994 to pursue other interests outside of music the other four members auditioned multiple steel guitarists and by october 1994 they had selected greg trostle as his replacementlater in 1994 the band began recording new songs with stroud they signed with giant records in late 1994 and released their first single and video for the label by years end titled you could do better the song failed to chart and did not appear on an album 282 the bands next single release for giant was paradise in 1995 a review in billboard described the songs lyrics as simplistic but praised mccorveys singing this would serve as the title track to their only giant album paradise by this point trostle had left the band as well and session musician paul franklin played steel guitar on the album other contributing musicians included guitarist dann huff pianist johnny neel and backing vocalists john wesley ryles and curtis wright david malloy produced the album collaborating with stroud on seven of the ten tracks the albums closing track was a live rendition of feed jake shawn ryan of new country magazine praised the album for its upbeat romps and songs with a keen eye for detailing the heart of bluecollar life with respect and affection writing for the ottawa citizen susan beyer praised the everyday attitudes of the lyrics also calling mccorveys singing voice capable of great tenderness and power john anderson released the title track as a single in early 1996 for an album also titled paradise on which stroud was also a producerpirates of the mississippi disbanded in 1996 due to the band members tiring of their constant touring schedule prior to their retirement they were playing about 250 shows a year they held a farewell tour which lasted most of the year with their last show being at the county fair in isle of wight county virginia mccorvey did a number of shows that same year in montgomery alabama with a new set of musicians called the bill mccorvey band most of these shows were charity concerts for the american cancer

alves and mccorvey decided to reunite as pirates of the mississippi the two of them thought that reviving the band had potential due to a rise of rockinfluenced country in the intervening years they wrote a number of songs together for an album titled heaven and a dixie night released on the evergreen label that year kickin up dust served as the projects lead single jason macneil of allmusic gave the project a mixed review praising mccorveys voice and the country rock influences of the more uptempo tracks but also criticizing other tracks as containing typical country music fodder pirates of the mississippi played shows in local venues in alabama and tennessee before disbanding again in 2007 mccorvey founded an acoustic trio called buffalo rome before retiring from music in 2010 to open a liquor store in brentwood tennessee dean townson died of unknown causes on march 25 2010 at the age of 50now if you get an ear pierced some will call you gaybut if you drive a pickup theyll say no you must be straightwhat we are and what we aintwhat we can and what we cantdoes it really matterpirates of the mississippi feed jake 1991pirates of the mississippis style features elements of country rock rick harmon of the montgomery advertiser described their style as having influences ranging from led zeppelin to happy goodman family also calling their style a smoldering boogie because of their country rock influences the band was frequently compared to the kentucky headhunters a country rock band who made their chart debut in 1989 as pirates of the mississippis album was recorded before the kentucky headhunters debut but not released until later mccorvey thought that the initial commercial success of the kentucky headhunters had made country radio more accepting of a band with rock influences in the early 1990s robert k oermann wrote in the tennessean that the band had a rootsy raucous casual country rock blend in the same article alves stated that he intended for the band not to have an individual image unlike other contemporary bands as he thought wellwritten songs would serve as an image on their own mccorvey said that he was inspired by southern rock acts he listened to growing up he also stated that he preferred to write most of the bands music with alves but was open to outside material if he thought it was suitable bernard pilon of the leaderpost described mccorvey as having a gravelled edge reminiscent of blues man jeff healey with pete swanson of the great falls tribune noting the nofrill threepart harmonies provided by townson and alvesmany of the bands songs feature sociopolitical themes in the lyrics although severs said this was not a primary intention of theirs feed jake received media attention for including a lyric supportive of the gay community according to mccorvey some stations refused to play the song for this reason thus impacting its position on the charts the editors of the encyclopedia of country music also considered the song unusual in the bands discography as it was a ballad compared to the bar band attitude of their other releases the songs video portrays a relationship between two men one of whom dies at the end because of this storyline some viewers thought the video portrayed a gay relationship while others thought the man who died was a soldier in the gulf war representatives of deatonflanigen productions stated the video was not intended to have any individual meaning mccorvey wrote a street man named desire which is about a man who becomes homeless upon losing his job after noticing fans who attended meetandgreets at radio stations would often say they were unable to afford going to the bands concerts because they had just lost their jobs despite the songs failure at radio the band performed a number of charity concerts to assist homeless and lowincome individuals
