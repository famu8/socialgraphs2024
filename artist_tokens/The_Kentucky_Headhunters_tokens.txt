twelve songs which johnson and the band wrote over the course of four days the album featured johnson on piano as well as lead vocals on the title track and one other song jimmy hall of wet willie also played harmonica and saxophone and sang backing vocals thom owens of allmusic wrote of this album that they certainly can work a heavy bluesy groove with dexterity but they lack the gonzo charm they had on their debut pickin on nashville — there simply isnt the sense of careening fun nor is there the reckless fusions that resulted in such an invigorating listen one year later mercury released a greatest hits package the best of the kentucky headhunters still pickin it reprised singles and other songs from the bands first three albums as well as lets work together and a cover of the beatles youve got to hide your love away which the kentucky headhunters had previously recorded on the 1994 tribute album shared vision the songs of the beatles after still pickin the kentucky

enjoys what they are doing and highlighted the presence of a horn section and hammond b3 organ on some tracks ray waddell of billboard magazine considered wynans and johnsons contributions perfect
