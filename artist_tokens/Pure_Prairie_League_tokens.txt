duels with fuller that created the signature sound of the band they rose to popularity as the house band at new dillys pub in the mt adams section of cincinnatiin mid1971 mcgrail and stokes left the band to rehearse with bill bartlett but were unable to put a viable band together jim caughlan who had played guitar and drums with fuller call and mcgrail in earlier bands took over on drums and jim lanham from california formerly of the yellow payges and country funk replaced stokes on bass suskind departed as well soon after the arrival of caughlan and lanham early on pure prairie league was looking for national artist representation and made contact with a wellknown cleveland based rock and roll promoter roger abramson at the behest of the groups roadie jim westy westermeyer who had also worked for the james gang abramson saw the band at new dillys pub and later signed them to a management contract abramson was able to land a contract with rca records he then placed pure prairie league as an opening act with many of the concerts he produced at that timetheir selftitled first album used a norman rockwell saturday evening post cover showing a trailworn cowboy named sad luke who would appear on the cover of every pure prairie league recording thereafter after releasing their debut album recorded in new york city in march 1972 and embarking on a nationwide tour call caughlan and lanham all left the bandat that point pure prairie league owed rca another album and craig fuller agreed to record the second record in rcas toronto studio with the help of george ed powell and bob ringe who had also produced the first album al brisco played pedal steel guitar on the session bustin out begun in the summer of 1972 was produced by ringe and featured the songs of fuller and powell billy hinds from cincinnati joined the band on drums and hindss friend michael connor played piano on most of the sessions and would become a regular in the pure prairie league lineup for years to come mick ronson added string arrangements to several tracks most notably boulder skies and call me tell me michael reilly who would become the longtime bass player and front man for the band joined in early september 1972 soon after the record was completed bustin out was released in october 1972reilly explains how he came to be involved with ppli was from fort thomas kentucky right near the ohio border when i was 14 i went out to sears and bought a danelectro silvertone bass learned how to play it got a couple of guys together and we formed a band called the marc iv we played swim clubs and sock hops and stuff like that back in 1964 eventually i joined the last incarnation of the lemon pipers of green tambourine fame i wasn ’ t on the original recordings and i wasn ’ t touring with the original band but they were from the same area i was from oxford ohio as a teenager i used to play the bars in oxford every weekend and i knew all the guys who had been in that band bill bartlett was a great guitar player and dale brown was the lead singer i eventually moved to woodstock new york and was in a band called the robert lee band with this singersongwriter from florida named robert lee michael conner and billy hinds — the piano player and drummer from pure prairie league — were living in woodstock as well and we got a chance to record an album in london “ amie ” was recorded in the summer of 1972 and was released around christmas of ’ 72 or january of ’ 73 but we had started touring for that album in september of 1972 the first show i ever played with pure prairie league was on labor day of ’ 72 and that was at the erie canal soda pop festival in bull island illinois most of the woodstock lineup along with 300000 people were there so it was quite a way to start we signed with a booking agency in minneapolis called variety artists international and they were one of the biggest college booking agents in the country so we went out and we started touring at different colleges doing 250–275 shows a year for eight years in a row or so that was it — pretty much it was us jamming “ amie ” down every college student ’ s throat plus lots of kids in college at that time wanted to learn how to play guitar and “ amie ” was a pretty easy song for them to learn on so it became a popular college hit all the college radio stations started playing it and then other radio stations were picking it up too and then rca finally perked up and said “ we got ta find these guys and see what ’ s going onshortly after touring behind bustin out the group returned to ohio and fuller had to face trial for charges of draft evasion in kentucky but before conscientious objector co status could be arranged he was sentenced to six months in jail and forced to leave pure prairie league in february 1973 at this point rca dropped the band and their future looked bleakby august 1973 the band members were in cincinnati and managed to persuade call to return fuller though out of prison by now was working the late shift in a community hospital to satisfy his co requirements and was not inclined to rejoin at that time he was eventually given a full pardon by president gerald ford reilly took over as the bands leader and front man and brought in his friend larry goshorn vocals guitars to replace fuller in november 1973 goshorn had played in a popular ohio band called the sacred mushroompure prairie league hit the road and began playing gigs constantly mostly in the northeast midwest and southeast as reilly related above as a result of their heavy schedule particularly at colleges their songs became well known amie craig fullers ode to an onagainoffagain relationship from the second album became a particular favoriteas amie grew in popularity radio stations began receiving requests for it as a result rca rereleased the bustin out and pure prairie league albums and reissued amie as a single it peaked at no 27 on april 26 1975 just as a minor bluegrass revival was underway on midwestern college campusesrca resigned pure prairie league who relocated to los angeles and recorded their third album two lane highway which was released in
