music circuit his focus on rock and roll gave way to american folk music as he explained in a 1985 interviewthe thing about rocknroll is that for me anyway it wasnt enough there were great catchphrases and driving pulse rhythms but the songs werent serious or didnt reflect life in a realistic way i knew that when i got into folk music it was more of a serious type of thing the songs are filled with more despair more sadness more triumph more faith in the supernatural much deeper feelingsduring this period he began to introduce himself as bob dylan in his memoir he wrote that he considered adopting the surname dillon before unexpectedly seeing poems by dylan thomas and deciding upon the given name spelling in a 2004 interview he said youre born you know the wrong names wrong

traveled to new york city to perform and visit his musical idol woody guthrie at greystone park psychiatric hospital guthrie had been a revelation to dylan and influenced his early performances he

signed a management contract with albert grossman grossman remained dylans manager until 1970 and was known for his sometimes confrontational personality and protective loyalty dylan said he was kind of like a colonel tom parker figure you could smell him coming tension between grossman and john hammond led to the latter suggesting dylan work with the jazz producer tom wilson who produced several tracks for the second album without formal credit wilson produced the next three albums dylan recordeddylan made his first trip to the united kingdom from december 1962 to january 1963 he had been invited by television director philip saville to appear in madhouse on castle street which saville was directing for bbc television at the end of the play dylan performed blowin in the wind one of its first public performances while in london dylan performed at london folk clubs including the troubadour les cousins and bunjies he also learned material from uk performers including martin carthyby the release of dylans second album the freewheelin bob dylan in may 1963 he had begun to make his name as a singersongwriter many songs on the album were labeled protest songs inspired partly by guthrie and influenced by pete seegers topical songs oxford town was an account of james merediths ordeal as the first black student to enroll at the university of mississippi the first song on the album blowin in the wind partly derived its melody from the traditional slave song no more auction block while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo the song was widely recorded by other artists and became a hit for peter paul and mary a hard rains agonna fall was based on the folk ballad lord randall with its apocalyptic premonitions the song gained resonance when the cuban missile crisis developed a few weeks after dylan began performing it both songs marked a new direction in songwriting blending a streamofconsciousness imagist lyrical attack with traditional folk formdylans topical songs led to his being viewed as more than just a songwriter janet maslin wrote of freewheelin these were the songs that established as the voice of his generation—someone who implicitly understood how concerned young americans felt about nuclear disarmament and the growing civil rights movement his mixture of moral authority and nonconformity was perhaps the most timely of his attributesfreewheelin also included love songs and surreal talking blues humor was an important part of dylans persona and the range of material on the album impressed listeners including the beatles george harrison said of the album we just played it just wore it out the content of the song lyrics and just the attitude—it was incredibly original and wonderfulthe rough edge of dylans singing unsettled some but attracted others author joyce carol oates wrote when we first heard this raw very young and seemingly untrained voice frankly nasal as if sandpaper could sing the effect was dramatic and electrifying many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers such as joan baez who became dylans advocate and lover baez was influential in bringing dylan to prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him on stage during her concerts others who had hits with dylans songs in the early 1960s included the byrds sonny cher the hollies the association manfred mann and the turtlesmixedup confusion recorded during the freewheelin sessions with a backing band was released as dylans first single in december 1962 but then swiftly withdrawn in contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album the single showed a willingness to experiment with a rockabilly sound cameron crowe described it as a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards elvis presley and sun recordsin may 1963 dylans political profile rose when he walked out of the ed sullivan show during rehearsals dylan had been told by cbs televisions head of program practices that talkin john birch paranoid blues was potentially libelous to the john birch society rather than comply with censorship dylan refused to appeardylan and baez were prominent in the civil rights movement singing together at the march on washington on august 28 1963 dylan performed only a pawn in their game and when the ship comes indylans third album the times they are achangin reflected a more politicized dylan the songs often took as their subject matter contemporary stories with only a pawn in their game addressing the murder of civil rights worker medgar evers and the brechtian the lonesome death of hattie carroll the death of black hotel barmaid hattie carroll at the hands of young white socialite william zantzinger ballad of hollis brown and north country blues addressed despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities the final track on the album contained dylan ’ s angry response to a hostile profile of the singer that had appeared in newsweek magazine as biographer clinton heylin puts it the newsweek journalist wrote a story about the way the bar mitzvah boy from hibbing minnesota had reinvented himself as the prince of protest emphasising his birth name robert zimmerman his attendance at the university of minnesota and his close relationship with his parents whom he claimed to be estranged from the day after the article appeared dylan returned to the studio to record “ restless farewell ” which ends with his vow to “ make my stand and remain as i am and bid farewell and not give a damn ” by the end of 1963 dylan felt manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements accepting the tom paine award from the emergency civil liberties committee shortly after the assassination of john f kennedy an intoxicated dylan questioned the role of the committee characterized the members as old and balding and claimed to see something of himself and of every man in kennedys assassin lee harvey oswaldanother side of bob dylan recorded in a single evening on june 9 1964 had a lighter mood the humorous dylan reemerged on i shall be free no 10 and motorpsycho nightmare spanish harlem incident and to ramona are passionate love songs while black crow blues and i dont believe you she acts like we never have met suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate dylans music it aint me babe on the surface a song about spurned love has been described as a rejection of the role of political spokesman thrust upon him his new direction was signaled by two lengthy songs the impressionistic chimes of freedom which sets social commentary against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by allen ginsberg as chains of flashing images and my back pages which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former championsin the latter half of 1964 and into 1965 dylan moved from folk songwriter to folkrock popmusic star his jeans and work shirts were replaced by a carnaby street wardrobe sunglasses day or night and pointed beatle boots a london reporter noted hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge a loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of leicester square he looks like an undernourished cockatoo dylan began to spar with interviewers asked about a movie he planned while on les cranes television show he told crane it would be a cowboy horror movie asked if he played the cowboy dylan replied no i play my mother dylans late march 1965 album bringing it all back home was another leap featuring his first recordings with electric instruments under producer tom wilsons guidance the first single subterranean homesick blues owed much to chuck berrys too much monkey business its freeassociation lyrics described as harking back to the energy of beat poetry and as a forerunner of rap and hiphop the song was provided with an early music video which opened d a pennebakers cinéma vérité presentation of dylans 1965 british tour dont look back instead of miming dylan illustrated the lyrics by throwing cue cards containing key words on the ground pennebaker said the sequence was dylans idea and it has been imitated in music videos and advertisementsthe second side of bringing it all back home contained four long songs on which dylan accompanied himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica mr tambourine man became one of his bestknown songs when the byrds recorded an electric version that reached number one in the us and uk its all over now baby blue and its alright ma im only bleeding were two of dylans most important compositionsin 1965 headlining the newport folk festival dylan performed his first electric set since high school with a pickup group featuring mike bloomfield on guitar and al kooper on organ dylan had appeared at newport in 1963 and 1964 but in 1965 was met with cheering and booing and left the stage after three songs one version has it that the boos were from folk fans whom dylan had alienated by appearing unexpectedly with an electric guitar murray lerner who filmed the performance said i absolutely think that they were booing dylan going electric an alternative account claims audience members were upset by poor sound and a short setdylans performance provoked a hostile response from the folk music establishment in the september issue of sing out ewan maccoll wrote our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time but what of bobby dylan scream the outraged teenagers only a completely noncritical audience nourished on the watery pap of pop music could have fallen for such tenthrate drivel on july 29 four days after newport dylan was back in the studio in new york recording positively 4th street the lyrics contained images of vengeance and paranoia and have been interpreted as dylans putdown of former friends from the folk community he had known in clubs along west 4th streetin july 1965 dylans sixminute single like a rolling stone peaked at number two in the us chart in 2004 and in 2011 rolling stone listed it as number one on the 500 greatest songs of all time bruce springsteen recalled first hearing the song that snare shot sounded like somebodyd kicked open the door to your mind the song opened dylans next album highway 61 revisited named after the road that led from dylans minnesota to the musical hotbed of new orleans the songs were in the same vein as the hit single flavored by mike bloomfields blues guitar and al koopers organ riffs desolation row backed by acoustic guitar and understated bass offers the sole exception with dylan alluding to figures in western culture in a song described by andy gill as an 11minute epic of entropy which takes the form of a felliniesque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters poet philip larkin who also reviewed jazz for the daily telegraph wrote im afraid i poached bob dylans highway 61 revisited cbs out of curiosity and found myself well rewardedin support of the album dylan was booked for two us concerts with al kooper and harvey brooks from his studio crew and robbie robertson and levon helm former members of ronnie hawkinss backing band the hawks on august 28 at forest hills tennis stadium the group was heckled by an audience still annoyed by dylans electric sound the bands reception on september 3 at the hollywood bowl was more favorablefrom september 24 1965 in austin texas dylan toured the us and canada for six months backed by the five musicians from the hawks who became known as the band while

session men at dylans insistence robertson and kooper came from new york city to play on the sessions the nashville sessions produced the double album blonde on blonde 1966 featuring what dylan called

dylan a duet with johnny cash and the single lay lady lay variety wrote dylan is definitely doing something that can be called singing somehow he has managed to add an octave to his range during one recording session dylan and cash recorded a series of duets but only their version of girl from the north country appeared on the album the album influenced the nascent genre of country rockin 1969 dylan was asked to write songs for scratch archibald macleishs musical adaptation of the devil and daniel webster macleish initially praised dylans contributions writing to him those songs of yours

publish it the book attracted negative reviews but later critics have suggested its affinities with finnegans wake and a season in hellbetween march 16 and 19 1971 dylan recorded with leon russell at blue rock a small studio in greenwich village these sessions resulted in watching the river flow and a new recording of when i paint my masterpiece on november 4 1971 dylan recorded george jackson

records expired his next album planet waves was recorded in the fall of 1973 using the band as his backing group as they rehearsed for a major tour the album included two versions of forever young

of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental columbia records simultaneously released dylan a collection of studio outtakes widely interpreted as a churlish response to dylans signing with a rival record labelin january 1974 dylan backed by the band embarked on a north american tour of 40 concerts—his first tour for seven years a live double album before the flood was released on asylum records soon according to clive davis columbia records sent word they will spare nothing to bring dylan back into the fold dylan had second thoughts about asylum unhappy that geffen had sold only 600000

the accompaniments as often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes in rolling stone jon landau wrote that the record has been made with typical shoddiness over the years critics came to see it as one of dylans masterpieces in salon journalist bill wyman wrote blood on the tracks is his only flawless album and his best produced the songs each of them are constructed in disciplined fashion it is his kindest album and most dismayed and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrheaplagued excesses of his mid1960s output and the selfconsciously simple compositions of his postaccident yearsin the middle of 1975 dylan championed boxer rubin hurricane carter imprisoned for triple murder with his ballad hurricane making the case for carters innocence

and carole bayer sager and two solo compositions by dylan a reviewer wrote that the record follows too many detours to be consistently compelling and some of those detours wind down roads that are indisputably dead ends by 1986 such uneven records werent entirely unexpected by dylan but that didnt make them any less frustrating it was the first dylan album since his 1962 debut to fail to make the top 50 some critics have called the song dylan cowrote with shepard brownsville girl a masterpiecein 1986 and 1987 dylan toured with tom petty and the heartbreakers sharing vocals with petty on

poorly than knocked out loaded gray wrote the very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new bob dylan album as something significant the critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the traveling wilburys a supergroup dylan cofounded with george harrison jeff lynne roy orbison and tom petty in late 1988 their traveling wilburys vol 1 reached number three on the us albums chart featuring songs described as dylans most accessible compositions in years despite orbisons
