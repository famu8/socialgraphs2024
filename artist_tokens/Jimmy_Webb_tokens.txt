and released as the bside of macarthur park webb finished the year by writing arranging and producing thelma houstons first album sunshoweras the decade came to a close so too did webbs string of hit singles he began to withdraw from the formulaic process in which he worked and began to experiment with his music he started work on a semiautobiographical broadway musical called his own dark city which reflected the emotional displacement he felt at the time he also wrote music for the films how sweet it is and tell them willie boy is herewebbs career as a singersongwriter got off to a rough start with the counterfeit album jim webb sings jim webb released by epic records in 1968 according to webb the album was produced by a bunch of ruffians from some old demos of mine and tarted up to sound like macarthur park beginning in 1970 webb released six original albums of his own songs words and music 1970 and so on 1971 letters 1972 lands end 1974 el mirage 1977 and angel heart 1982 despite the critical reception that followed each of these projects webb has never been as successful as a performer as he has been as a songwriter and arranger each album was noted for its inventive music and memorable lyricswebbs debut album as a performer words and music was released on reprise records in late 1970 to critical acclaim rolling stone writer jon landau called one of the albums cuts pf sloan a masterpiece could not be improved upon the album also features the ambitious song trilogy music for an unmade movie webbs 1971 followup album and so on proved equally appealing to critics rolling stone declared the album another impressive step in the conspiracy to recover his identity from the housewives of america and rightfully install him at the forefront of contemporary composersperformers the album features the songs met her on a plane all my loves laughter and marionette also in 1971 the three degrees are featured in the movie the french connection giving a rendition of webbs song everybody gets to go to the moon originally recorded in 1969 by thelma houstonwebbs 1972 album letters which features his own rendition of galveston met with similar praise music critic bruce eder called letters the most surprising diverse and possibly the most satisfying of all of jimmy webbs early solo lps and arguably the best of webbs solo albums in his review of the album peter reilly of stereo review wrote jimmy webb is the most important pop music figure to emerge since bob dylan the album also features the songs campo de encino an homage to his parklike residence in encino california during the 1970s when can brown begin and piano he also produced in 1972 album the supremes produced and arranged by jimmy webb for the supremes featuring jean terrell mary wilson and linda lawrence the album sold poorly and did not chart successfullyin 1974 webb released lands end on asylum records unlike his previous albums which tended to be underproduced webb was able to achieve a more heavily produced poprock sound on lands end which was recorded in england with the help of an allstar session band that included joni mitchell ringo starr and nigel olsson the album contains a thematic consistency in that most of its songs were tales of romantic discord while webb continued to improve as a singer he still hadnt found an identity as a solo artist the album features the songs ocean in his eyes just this one time and crying in my sleepin 1977 webb released el mirage on atlantic records produced arranged and conducted by the beatles former producer george martin the album was webbs most polished effort yet as a performer william ruhlmann observed these were lush tracks full of tasty playing and warm string charts on which webbs thin tenor was buoyed by numerous background vocalists the whole an excellent example of the style known as west coast pop the album contains several strong compositions including the highwayman which would later become a number one country hit for waylon jennings willie nelson johnny cash and kris kristofferson who named their super group the highwaymen after the song their version of the highwayman won a grammy award for best country song el mirage also features the songs if you see me getting smaller im leaving a newly arranged version of pf sloan and the moon is a harsh mistress which had already been recorded by joe cocker glen campbell and judy collins despite the positive critical response to the album el mirage did not succeed in redefining webb as a performer as he had hopedwebbs final solo album from this period angel heart was released in 1982 on lorimar records like its predecessor the album drew upon the talents of top los angeles session musicians to produce a classic west coast pop sound enhanced by guest vocal harmonies by gerry beckley michael mcdonald graham nash kenny loggins daryl hall and stephen bishop unlike his previous solo albums however angel heart lacked the quality material usually associated with the composer apart from scissors cut and in cars which were previously recorded by art garfunkel the album offered few high points despite its polished production a decade would pass before webb released his next solo albumthroughout the 1970s and into the 1980s webbs songs continued to be recorded by some of the industrys most successful artists in
