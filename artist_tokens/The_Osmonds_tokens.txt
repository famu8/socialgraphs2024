a popular variety show that ran until 1979a revival of the original osmond brothers lineup in the 1980s achieved moderate success in country music and both donny and marie separately made comebacks in their respective fields in the late1980s the osmonds have sold over 77 million records worldwidethe quartet continued to perform through their 50th anniversary in 2007 at which point alan and later

of the original quartet still performing donny continues to perform as a solo artist as well in later years alans sons particularly nathan and david have made appearances with their unclesgeorge virl osmond sr and olive osmond members of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints resided on a farm in ogden utah with their family george was a postal worker with a military background both he and olive were musicians within their church they had nine children virl tom alan wayne merrill jay donny marie and jimmy virl and tom were both born with severe hearing impairmentsthe osmond brothers career began in 1958 when alan wayne merrill and jay began singing barbershop music for local audiences in and around ogden as well as during their weekly church services in their madefortv movie inside the osmonds they explain that they originally performed to earn money to help buy hearing aids for virl and tom and to finance their future church missions despite their young ages ranging from nine to three years old within a few years the boys talent and stage presence were strong enough that their father took them to compete in an amateur barbershop singing competition in california 17–19 258 on the same trip they visited disneyland where tommy walker disneylands director of entertainment and customer relations from 1955 to 1966 found the osmond brothers singing with the dapper dans on main street 259 walker hired the osmonds to perform in the park during the following summer and to perform minor roles in the television series the travels of jaimie mcpheeters starring actor kurt russell 261 the family also appeared on a segment of disneyland after dark which first aired in april 1962 20 while the osmond brothers were working on disneyland after dark andy williamss father jay saw them and was so impressed he told his son to book them on his television show the andy williams show 21–22 andy did and the osmond brothers became regulars on the show from 1962 to 1967 where they earned the nickname onetake osmonds among staff due to their professionalism and tireless rehearsing donny soon joined them on the show making the osmond brothers a fivemember group 24 marie and jimmy were also introduced on the show a few years later during this time the osmonds also toured europe performing with swedens most popular singer lars lönndahl and even releasing a single where they sang a swedish version of two dirty little hands fem smutsiga små fingrarthe andy williams show ended its first run in 1967 after which the osmond brothers were signed to the jerry lewis show staying with that show until it was canceled in 1969 after which they rejoined the andy williams show which had just returned for its second run they soon decided they wanted to perform popular music and become a rock and roll band prompting them to shed their varietyshow image this change was difficult for their father who was suspicious of rock and roll but he was persuaded and the boys began performing as a pop band george osmond used his military training to keep his sons strictly regimentedin 1967 the osmonds had the single flower music bw i cant stop released by uni records the song failed to become a hit the group saw several other singles released over the next four years failing to score a hit until the 1971 chart debut of one bad applerecord producer mike curb saw the osmonds perform as a band and recognized that they combined a rare mix of polished performing style instrumental skill and vocal talent he signed the osmonds to mgm records and arranged for them to record at muscle shoals with rb producer rick hall under halls guidance the osmonds hit the top spot on the pop chart with one bad apple in 1971 the song one bad apple written by george jackson was composed in the style of the jackson 5 it was not originally offered to the jackson 5 though the osmonds would later state that the jackson 5 considered recording it the osmond and jackson families would eventually meet in 1972 and become friends one bad apple debuted on the billboard hot 100 on 2 january 1971 first hitting no 1 in february where it stayed for five weeksthe osmonds soon had hits with other light rbstyle pop numbers like double lovin no 14 and yoyo no 3 in each of these hits the formula was the same merrill sang lead and donny was colead in essence singing the hook or chorus of the song at this time the osmonds also recorded several songs that were billed to donny the lead soloist on the songs sweet and innocent no 7 go away little girl no 1 hey girl no 9 and puppy love no 3 uni records also rereleased their 1967 single flower music this time with i cant stop as the aside where it reached no 96 their transition to pop stars required more elaborate choreography than their original work had required so older brother virl osmond taught the quintet how to dance olive osmond initially taught the quintet how to sing harmony the harmony arrangements eventually fell upon wayne who was found to have perfect pitchthe osmonds began writing and performing their own music and their sound moved towards rock music beginning with their album phase iii in addition to yoyo phase iii produced the major hit down by the lazy river no 4 their next crazy horses album was the bands first personal statement – the brothers have been quoted as saying that the title song refers to air pollution from cars and its instrumentation featured an even harder rock sound bordering on early heavy metal they wrote all the songs and played all the instruments with alan on rhythm guitar wayne on lead guitar merrill on lead vocals and bass jay on drums and donny on keyboards all of the brothers sang backing vocals and an occasional lead on album cuts donny largely switched to instrumental contributions for much of 1972 to accommodate his changing voice by 1973 donny had settled from his former boy soprano range into a smooth baritenor voicedonnys voice change was a major upset to the groups original formula for success largely eliminating merrills youngsounding coleads voice and forcing merrills mature tenor voice to strain to cover most of the higher notes with audible difficulty through the next few years the success of crazy horses singles hold her tight no 14 and title track crazy horses on which donny did not sing but did contribute with a prominent keyboard riff kept the group very popular through 1973 as the group toured donny continued to sing his solo hits with the band progressively lowering the key until his voice change was completewith their cleancut image talent and energetic poprock sound the osmonds toured to crowds of fans across the united states by this time the osmonds had broken through in the united kingdom as well counting group and solo recordings members of the osmond family charted 13 singles on the uk charts in 1973 some observers coined a new word osmondmania to describe the phenomenon by analogy with the similar beatlemania of the previous decade the group also had their own saturdaymorning cartoon series in 1972 and 1973 the osmonds on abctvthe older osmond brothers were of age to go on church missions typically mandatory for members of the church noting that the osmonds music career was a major publicity boon for the church that had brought tens of thousands of new members the church exempted the osmonds from missionary service on the logic that the group served as de facto missionaries for the faith through their fame and music merrill would eventually serve a mission in 2022 after the group disbanded they recorded an ambitious album in 1973 called the plan perhaps best described as a mormon concept album with progressive rock aspirations one reviewer suggested that the plan carried a toostrong religious message given that mormonism is fairly conservative and not usually associated with the themes of rockandroll the reviewer likewise suggested that the music was too varied and too experimental the album produced only two minor hits let me in and goin home both no 36 in the united states although they both went top 5 in the united kingdom and let me in was also a major hit on the easy listening chartsfollowing the release of the plan the popularity of the osmonds as a group began to decline alan wayne and merrill all married their wives in 1973 and 1974 donny married in 1978 jay would not marry until 1987 and the band began to slow their tour circuit the plan was also a major departure from the pop music which made them so popular the combination of this album along with donnys voice change the year before meant that the osmonds popularity with young fans would waneanother major factor in the bands decline was the sheer diversity of its output within three years the osmonds had waffled between bubblegum pop hard rock and easy listening and donnys solo career as an oldies cover artist further muddled the bands direction donnys collaboration with steve and eydie we can make it together which alan wayne and merrill had penned for donny came out on the easy listening charts at the same time the much harder crazy horses song was chartingdonny marie and jimmy soon began to emerge as solo artists jimmy was becoming big in japan and in 1972 had a no 1 hit in the united kingdom with long haired lover from liverpool marie then 13 years old hit no 1 on the us country chart in 1973 with paper roses a song originally recorded by anita bryant a decade before donny had a string of pop hits with covers of earlier teenpop songs including go away little girl no 1 originally by steve lawrence puppy love no 3 a paul anka composition and the twelfth of never no 8 originally recorded by johnny mathis between 1971 and 1976 donny had twelve top 40 hits including five in the top 10 for most of these the osmonds were still performing as a full band but backing and giving star billing to donny while he sang leaddonnys numerous solo hits have led many to assume he was the groups lead singer merrill was usually the lead singer donny would usually sing the choruses on songs billed to the osmonds thus being a colead all five members of the group sang lead at various times jay would sing lead on some of the groups harder rock tunes while alan and wayne would occasionally contribute a lead vocal on some album tracks donnys emergence as a solo star and the record companys desire to appeal to the teengirl audience often thrust donny out in front of the groupby now the family was touring recording creating and producing for five technically separate artists the osmonds donny osmond marie osmond and jimmy osmond – plus donny and marie had begun recording duets and had hits with im leaving it up to you no 4 and morning side of the mountain no 8 through all the stress and pressures created by these many efforts the family hung together largely at georges command the 2001 abctv movie inside the osmonds depicts the family mottoes as being it doesnt matter whos out front as long as its an osmond and family faith and career in that orderthe original osmonds as a group still produced hits in 1974 love me for a reason reached no 10 in the united states and no 1 in the united kingdom the irish boy band boyzone took the song to no 2 in the uk in 1994 love me for a reason was the title track to the album of the same name which featured a blueeyed soul format their fourth style change in less than a decade arranged by h b barnumby 1976 though the groups record sales were softening their 1975 album the proud one sold poorly despite the title track a cover of a frankie valli minor hit providing a charttopping easy listening hit and the groups last us top40 hit to date and mgm records was sold to polygram their first album on the subsidiary label polydor was the album brainstorm that album sold only slightly better than its predecessor and its lead single i cant live a dream another valli cover fell short of the top 40 polydor would release two more albums from the family a christmas album that included all of the performing family members and a greatest hits compilationin 1976 abc offered donny and marie their own television show the donny marie show george demanded that the osmond brothers work behind the scenes on the show the family and abc built and operated osmond studios a firstclass television studio in orem utah where the show was produced beginning in 1977 as a result the osmonds as a performing band became a lower priority to donny and marie the older brothers deferred or gave up their dreams of being a rockandroll band although donny and marie as a duo continued to record hits into 1978 in an interview with the lost 45s wayne osmond suggested their abandonment of songwriting and not working on material during the tv run may have been a mistake as their career never recovered from the hiatus various members of the family struggled with the transition donny experienced stage anxiety merrill struggled with bipolar disorder and marie had a brief bout with an eating disorder after a network executive told her she looked heavy 59 both donny and marie were offered roles in the 1978 film adaptation of the hit musical grease with donny being considered for the role of the teen angel and marie for the role of sandy marie turned the role down concerned that the characters rebellious turn at the end was not a fit for her donny and marie instead chose to star in goin coconuts under the belief that it would be more familyfriendly which ended up being a critical and commercial failurethe donny marie show was canceled in 1979 and the osmonds found themselves in debt and without a clear direction the group switched from polydor to corporate affiliate mercury records and released another album steppin out was a transitional album for the osmonds and was produced by maurice gibb among its tracks was the first recorded version of rest your love on me a country song that became a hit for gibbs group the bee gees and topped the country charts in a cover version by conway twitty steppin out itself was a major failure with the album failing to chart and its only charting single youre mine reaching only to no 138 on the record world charts it would be their only album on the mercury labelthe family also produced two unsuccessful projects for marie a sitcom pilot that never aired and a variety show revival that lasted seven episodes in 1980 and 1981 donny permanently separated from the group and for a time from marie shortly thereafter the family also fell prey to embezzlers who came on as business partners to help finance the television show several went to prison for their crimesgeorge osmond refused to let the family declare bankruptcy and ordered his children honor all of their financial obligations by whatever means necessary effectively forcing the osmonds to return to the roadmarie recorded several successful duets with donny and continued to sing country music she had several top 40 country hits in the mid1980s the biggest of which was meet me in montana with dan seals no 1 she starred in the broadway revivals of the musicals the king and i as the lead anna and the

on postpartum depression titled marie osmond behind the smiledonny returned to the pop music scene in 1989 when he released soldier of love to much success in the united kingdom american music industry insiders were wary of the osmond brand and promoted the song as being by a mystery artist the song became a turntable hit in this manner and when osmonds identity as the mystery artist was revealed soldier of love eventually rose to no 2 on the us charts and was enough of a success to warrant followup singles including sacred emotion which peaked at no 13 and my love is a fire which peaked at no 21 in 1998 donny sang ill make a man out of you for the film mulan he performed on broadway as gaston in the stage production of beauty and the beast and also gave over 2000 performances

addition to a handful that reached the bottom of or narrowly missed the top 40 the osmond brothers record sales were hampered by a reluctance to go on tour the group instead opted to stay in branson

performers in terms of having their hits of the 1970s survive in recurrent rotation classic hits and oldies stations rarely play any of their music with the occasional exception of one bad apple according to sean ross at radioinsight discussing the fifteen popular songs of 1971 that saw the biggest declines in airplayteen acts had been with us from the beginning of course but not since the early ‘ 60s had they seemed so particularly stigmatized five songs by teen idols – four of them osmondsrelated we haven ’ t shown individual breakouts for every year of the ‘ 70s but we can tell you that there ’ s an osmondsrelated song every year between 1971 and 1976 except for 1973 when donny osmond was being challenged by the defranco family and didn ’ t have a big enough hitross later noted of the top 100 songs in the 1970 to 1974 period ranked by a dropoff in airplay the osmond family had six listed the most of any collection of acts this was twice as high as the next two artists on the list cher and helen reddy each of whom recorded three the osmond family as a whole ranked the most neglected musical act of the era of the classic hit from 1970 to 1994 broadening to the period of 1960 to 1999 the top 100 most neglected songs which had a disproportionate number of early 1960s songs largely neglected by modern radio had three performed by at least one osmond tied for the most with connie francis on the list this was especially notable because other neglected 1970s artists such as reddy and barbra streisand failed to make the broader list at all such was the osmonds fall into obscurity that karen osmond jays second and current wife had never heard of the group before meeting him while donnys son chris advanced all the way to the final episode of season 2 of claim to fame largely because most of the contestants were repeatedly unaware who donny wasolive osmond mother of the osmond siblings died on 9 may 2004 at age 79 their father george osmond died on 6 november
