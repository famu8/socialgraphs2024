john weldon j j cale december 5 1938 – july 26 2013 was an american guitarist singer and songwriter though he avoided the limelight his influence as a musical artist has been acknowledged by figures such as neil young mark knopfler waylon jennings and eric clapton who described him as one of the most important artists in rock history he is one of the originators of the tulsa sound a loose genre drawing on blues rockabilly country and jazzin 2008 cale and clapton received a grammy award for their album the road to escondidocale was born on december 5 1938 in oklahoma city oklahoma he was raised in tulsa oklahoma and graduated from tulsa central high school in 1956 as well as learning to play the guitar he began studying the principles of sound engineering while still living with his parents in tulsa where he built himself a recording studio after graduation he was drafted into military service studying at the air force air training command in rantoul illinois cale recalled i didnt really want to carry a gun and do all that stuff so i joined the air force and what i did is i took technical training and thats kind of where i learned a little bit about electronics cales knowledge of mixing and sound recording turned out to play an important role in creating the distinctive sound of his studio albumsalong with a number of other young tulsa musicians cale moved to los angeles in late 1964 where he found employment as a studio engineer as well as playing at bars and clubs cale first tasted success that year when singer mel mcdaniel scored a regional hit with cales song lazy me he managed to land a regular gig at the increasingly popular whisky a go go in march 1965 with johnny rivers already performing there regularly club coowner elmer valentine rechristened cale as jj cale to avoid confusion with the john cale in the velvet underground in 1966 while living in the city he cut a demo single with liberty records of his songs after midnight with slow motion as the b side he distributed copies of the single to his tulsa musician friends living in los angeles many of whom were successfully finding work as session musicians after midnight would go on to have longterm ramifications for cales career when eric clapton recorded the song and it became a top 20 hit cale found little success as a recording artist not being able to make enough money as a studio engineer he sold his guitar and returned to tulsa in late 1967 there he joined a band with tulsa musician don whitein 1970 it came to his attention that eric clapton had recorded cales after midnight on his debut album cale who was languishing in obscurity at the time had no knowledge of claptons recording until it became a radio hit in 1970 he recalled to mojo magazine that when he heard claptons version playing on his radio i was dirt poor not making enough to eat and i wasnt a young man i was in my thirties so i was very happy it was nice to make some money cales version of after midnight differs greatly from claptons frenetic version which is itself based on cales own arrangementthe history on that deal was the original after midnight i recorded was on liberty records on a 45rpm and it was fast that was about 196768 maybe 69 i cant remember exactly but that was the original after midnight and that is what clapton heard if you listen to eric claptons record what he did was imitate that no one heard that first version i made of it i tried to give the thing away until he cut it and made it popular so when i recorded the naturally album denny cordell who ran shelter records at the time and i had already finished the album he said john why dont you put after midnight on there because that is what people recognize you for i said well ive already got that on liberty records and eric claptons already cut it so if im going to do it again im going to do it slowit was suggested to cale that he should take advantage of this publicity and cut a record of his own his first album naturally released on october 25 1971 established his style described by los angeles times writer richard cromelin as a unique hybrid of blues folk and jazz marked by relaxed grooves and cales fluid guitar and iconic vocals his early use of drum machines and his unconventional mixes lend a distinctive and timeless quality to his work and set him apart from the pack of americana roots music purists his biggest us hit single crazy mama peaked at no 22 on the us billboard hot 100 chart in 1972 in the 2005 documentary film to tulsa and back cale recounts the story of being offered the opportunity to appear on dick clarks american bandstand to promote the song which would have moved it higher on the charts cale declined when told he could not bring his band to the recording and would be required to lipsync the wordsreally was produced by audie ashworth who would go on to produce cale until 1983 cales second album further developed the tulsa sound that he would become known for a swampy mix of folk jazz shuffling country blues and rock n roll although his songs have a relaxed casual feel cale who often used drum machines and layered his vocals carefully crafted his albums explaining to lydia hutchinson in 2013 i was an engineer and i loved manipulating the sound i love the technical side of recording i had a recording studio back in the days when no one had a home studio you had to rent a studio that belonged to a big conglomerate cale often acted as his own producer engineer session player his vocals sometimes whispery would be buried in the mix he attributed his unique sound to being a recording mixer and engineer saying because of all the technology now you can make music yourself and a lot of people are doing that now i started out doing that a long time ago and i found when i did that i came up with a unique soundalthough cale would not have the success with his music that others would the royalties from artists recording his songs would allow him to record and tour as it suited him he scored another windfall when lynyrd skynyrd recorded call me the breeze for their 1974 lp second helping as he put it in an interview with russell hall i knew if i became too well known my life would change drastically on the other hand getting some money doesnt change things too much except you no longer have to go to workhis third album okie contains some of cales most recorded songs in the same year of its release captain beefheart recorded i got the same old blues shortened to same old blues for his bluejeans moonbeams lp one of the few nonoriginals to ever appear on a beefheart album the song would also be recorded by eric clapton bobby bland lynyrd skynyrd and bryan ferry cajun moon was recorded by herbie mann on his 1976 album surprises with vocals by cissy houston by poco on their album cowboys englishmen and by randy crawford on naked and true 1995the 1976 album troubadour includes cocaine a song that would be a major hit for eric clapton the following year in the 2004 documentary to tulsa and back cale recalled i wrote cocaine and im a big fan of mose allisonso i had written the song in a mose allison bag kind of cocktail jazz kind of swingand audie said thats really a good song john but you oughta make that a little more rock and roll a little more commercial i said great man so i went back and recut it again as the thing you heard the songs meaning is ambiguous although eric clapton describes it as an antidrug song he has called the song quite cleverly anticocaine notingits no good to write a deliberate antidrug song and hope that it will catch because the general thing is that people will be upset by that it would disturb them to have someone else shoving something down their throat so the best thing to do is offer something that seems ambiguous—that on study or on reflection actually can be seen to be anti—which the song cocaine is actually an anticocaine song if you study it or look at it with a little bit of thought from a distance or as it goes by it just sounds like a song about cocaine but actually it is quite cleverly anticocaineby the time he recorded 5 in 1979 cale had also met singer and guitarist christine lakeland and the lp marks her first appearance on his albums in the 2005 documentary to tulsa and back lakeland says they met backstage at a prison benefit show featuring bb king and waylon jennings cale and lakeland would later marry as william ruhlmann observes in his allmusic review of the album as cales influence on others expanded he just continued to turn out the occasional album of bluesy minorkey tunes this one was even sparer than usual with the artist handling bass as well as guitar on many tracks listened to today it sounds so much like a dire straits album its scary the release of 5 coincided with a notable live session with leon russell recorded at russells paradise studios in june 1979 in los angeles the previously unseen footage features several tracks from 5 including sensitive kind loueasyann fate of a fool boilin pot and dont cry sister lakeland also performs with cales band while living in california in the late sixties cale worked in russells studio as an engineer the footage was officially released in 2003 as jj cale featuring leon russell in session at the paradise studioscale moved to california in 1980 and became a recluse living in a trailer without a telephone in 2013 he reflected …i knew what fame entailed i tried to back off from that i had seen some of the people i was working with forced to be careful because people wouldnt leave them alone… what im saying basically is i was trying to get the fortune without having the fame shades which continued cales tradition of giving his albums one word titles was recorded in various studios in nashville and los angeles it boasts an impressive list of top shelf session musicians including hal blaine and carol kaye of the wrecking crew james burton jim keltner reggie young glen d hardin ken buttrey and leon russell among many others 1982s grasshopper was recorded in studios in nashville and north hollywood and while a more polished production it continues cales exploration into a variety of musical styles that would become known as americanahis 1983 album 8 was poorly received and he asked to be released from his contract with polygram lyrically speaking with the exception of takin care of business the subject matter on 8 is unremittingly grim the cynical money talks youd be surprised the friends you can buy with small change… hard times unemployment and livin here too deal with harsh economic woes and dissatisfaction with life in general while the provocative reality is about using drugs to escape many of the problems he chronicles on the album singing one toke of reefer a little cocaine one shot of morphine and things begin to change and adding when reality leaves so do the blues when later asked how he had spent the 1980s he replied mowing the lawn and listening to van halen and rapafter making a name for himself in the seventies as a songwriter cales own recording career came to a halt in the mid1980s although he scored a handful of minor hits cale was indifferent to publicity preferring to avoid the spotlight so his albums never sold in high numbers1989s travellog was the first solo album cale produced himself without longtime producer audie ashworth although ashworth cowrote the opening track shanghaid with cale while the album has a travel theme with titles like tijuana and new orleans cale insisted he did not set out to make a concept album and only recognized it after he picked the songsits kind of ironic when andrew lauder of silvertone said hed like to put out some tapes i just got a bunch together and they put em out as an album it wasnt till i got to listening to the album that i noticed that id written a bunch of tunes in the last four or five years about towns and places and travellin aroundin 1990 he explained in an interview in 1984 i was with a different record company and it didnt seem to be working out too good so i asked to get out of my contract and that took a couple of years to shuffle the paper around then when i got through doin that i thought id take a little break from recording maybe go in once or twice a year and record somethin id writtenthe 1992 album number 10 was cales second lp for silvertone compared to his albums in the 70s and 80s he employed fewer session players for this album yet still achieved his signature sound notoriously wary of the spotlight cale quietly went about his own business his way delivering his own unique blend of musical styles augmented by his laidback vocal delivery ironically in an era of grunge and the mtv unplugged trends cale became immersed in electronics and synthesizers i did the unplugged live kind of thing in the 70s and the 80s he told one interviewer ive gone to the other direction now that all thats become popular been there done that they didnt call it unplugged in those days but that is what it was…there is a fascination about electronics…it is an art form in itself 1994s closer to you is best remembered for the change in sound from cales previous albums due to the prominence of synthesizers with cale employing the instrument on five of the twelve songs although the use of synthesizers may have seemed like a left turn for fans used to his laidback rootsy sound it was not new cale had used synthesizers on his 1976 troubadour album in an interview with vintage guitar in 2004 cale acknowledged the dismay some fans felt recalling…me playing with the synthesizer everybody hated audie ashworth did the first eight albums and those were kind of semipopular for an obscure songwriter like me then i started doing these albums in california with all synthesizers and me being the engineer i liked those but the folks wanted a little warmer kind of thingproduced by cale guitar man differs from the albums he made in the seventies and early eighties in that while those records featured numerous top shelf session players cale provided the instrumentation on guitar man himself augmented by wife christine lakeland on guitar and background vocals and drummer james cruce on the opener death in the wilderness in his allmusic review of the lp thom owens writes although he has recorded guitar man as a oneman band effort it sounds remarkably relaxed and laidback like it was made with a seasoned bar band in assessing the album rock writer brian wise of rhythm magazine commented lowdown is typical cale shuffle days go by gives a jazzy feel to a song about smoking a certain substance while the traditional old blue reprises a song that many might first have heard with the byrds version during the gram parsons era after guitar man cale would take a second hiatus and not release another album for eight yearsbetween 1996 and 2003 cale released no new music but admiration for his work and musicianship only grew among his fans and admirers in his 2003 biography shakey neil young remarked of all the players i ever heard its got ta be hendrix and j j cale who are the best electric guitar players in the 2005 documentary to tulsa and back on tour with jj cale cales guitar style is characterized by eric clapton as really really minimal adding its all about finesse mark knopfler was also effusive in his praise for the oklahoma troubadour but cales early 90s experimental synthheavy output left him at odds with the music industry 2004s to tulsa and back reunited him with longtime producer audie ashworth as he recalled to dan fortea few years ago before audie passed away i said ive been making synthesizer records aint nobody likes em but me ill come to nashville and well hire all the guys who are still alive who played on the first albums audie said great i told him to book some studio time but then he passed away and i put the deal on hold eventually i decided to do the same program only go to tulsa instead of nashville david teegarden of teegarden van winkle is a drummer who has a studio so i told him to get the guys in tulsa that we used to play with when we were kids i cut some there and had some demos i did here at the house and i sent them all to bas and to mike the album returns to the style and sound cale became famous for – a mix of laidback shuffles jazzy chords and bluesy rock and roll with layered vocals – but it also embraces technology resulting in a cleaner sound than on cales earlier albums lyrically cale makes a rare foray into political songwriting with the problem an indictment of thenpresident george w bush with lines like the man in charge he dont know what hes doing he dont know the world has changed stone river is an understated protest song about the water crisis in the westin 2004 eric clapton held the crossroads guitar festival a threeday festival in dallas texas among the performers was j j cale giving clapton the opportunity to ask cale to produce an album for him the two ended up recording the album together releasing it as the road to escondido a number of highprofile musicians also agreed to work on the album including billy preston derek trucks taj mahal pino palladino john mayer steve jordan and doyle bramhall ii in a coup whether intended or not the entire john mayer trio participated on this album in one capacity or another escondido is a city in san diego county near cales home at the time located in the small unincorporated town of valley center california eric clapton owned a mansion in escondido in the 1980s and early 90s the road referenced in the albums title is named valley center road the album won the grammy award for best contemporary blues album in 2008 with cale writing 11 of the 14 tracks on the album with two cuts any way the wind blows and dont cry sister being rerecordings of songs that cale recorded previously in the 1970s in a 2014 interview with npr clapton spoke at length about cales influence on his musicwhat seemed to evolve out of the 60s and into the 70s and then in another way the 80s — heavy metal came out of all of this stuff — was like volume and proficiency and virtuosity there didnt seem to be any reasonable limit to that it was just crazy i wanted to go in the other direction and try to find a way to make it minimal but still have a great deal of substance that was the essence of jjs music to me apart from the fact that he summed up so many of the different essences of american music rock and jazz and folk blues he just seemed to have an understanding of it allclapton who toured with delaney bonnie in 1969 recalled in the 2005 documentary to tulsa and back delaney bramlett is the one that was responsible to get me singing he was the one who turned me on to the tulsa community bramlett produced my first solo album and after midnight was on it and those players played on it461 ocean boulevard was my kind of homage to jjcale died at the age of 74 in san diego california on july 26 2013 following a heart attack stay around a posthumous album made of previously unreleased material was released on april 26 2019
