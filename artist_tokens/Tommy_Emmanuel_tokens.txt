referred to as travis picking of playing bass lines chords melodies and harmonies simultaneously using the thumb and fingers of the right hand achieving a dynamic range of sound from the instrument although emmanuels playing incorporates a multitude of musical influences and styles including jazz blues bluegrass folk and rock this type of country fingerstyle playing is at the core of his technique while emmanuel has never had formal music training and does not read or write music his natural musical ability intrinsic sense of rhythm and charisma gained him fans from all over the world as a solo performer he never plays to a setlist and uses a minimum of effects onstage he usually completes studio recordings in one takein his solo shows he mainly plays guitars made by maton an australian guitar manufacturer he usually travels with two custom maton ebg808 te models and one te1 model both of which are tommy emmanuel artist signature models he has played maton guitars for most of his career and is somewhat of an ambassador for the company due to his longstanding association with the brand emmanuel is known for the battered and worndown appearances of his guitars a result of his dynamic energetic playing and percussive techniques one of his signature performances for example involves striking the whole body of the guitar in various places with his hands or a drummers snaredrum brush to emulate the sound of a percussion kitemmanuel usually keeps one maton ebg808 in standard guitar tuning eadgbe while he tunes his second maton ebg808 to dgdgbe g6 tuning and his te1 to c♯f♯beg♯c♯ he generally uses 012 gauge light strings on one ebg808 and 013 gauge medium strings on the second maton ebg808 and on the te1 this allows him to quickly change tuning by swapping between guitars during a show if needed rather than spending time onstage retuning one guitaremmanuel often curls his left thumb around the neck of the guitar onto the fretboard to play some notes rather than using only his fingers to play — contrary to how classical guitarists play but not unusual for jazz and country guitarists he frequently plays common threefinger chord shapes with just two fingers he commonly uses a thumbpick a flat pick plectrum his fingers or a combination of these in his playing a style known as hybrid picking amongst his trademark rapid virtuoso licks and cascading harmonic progressions he often uses a technique that imitated an electric guitars tremolo system on acoustic guitar — by pressing the palm of his right hand against the sound board of the guitar near the neck joint while maintaining forward pressure with his left hand on the top of the headstock the guitar neck slightly bends away from the body and consequently affects the pitch of the strings to achieve the desired soundas a young man in australia emmanuel wrote to his hero chet atkins in nashville tennessee eventually atkins replied with words of encouragement and a longstanding invitation
