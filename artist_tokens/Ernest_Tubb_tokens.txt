bradley bradley played piano on many of tubbs recordings from the 1950s but tubb wanted him to sound like moon mullican the honkytonk piano great of that era the classicallytrained bradley tried but

blue tail fly jimmy crack corn with folk legend burl ives produced a top10 billboard hit and he was then eager to repeat that success he brought the upbeat fingernails tune to the session hoping that the trio would like it and they did not realizing how tall the texas troubadour was the recording technicians at decca had the sisters stand on a wooden box on one side of the one microphone they shared with tubb so the audio would balance the rhythm trio also was not used to tubbs vocal style as maxene once remembered he sang different than anybody ive ever heard he sang the melody of the song but the timing was different it wasnt like we were used toyou sing eight bars and then you sing eight bars and then you sing eight bars not with him he just sang eight bars ten bars eleven bars and then stopped whatever it was so wed just start to follow him and then got paid on 750000 records sold that never came above the masondixon linetubb was not known to possess the most adept voice he always sang flat and actually mocked his own singing he told an interviewer that 95 of the men in bars would hear his music on the juke box and say to their girlfriends i can sing better than him and
