all of these were produced by session keyboardist and record producer barry beckett who had contacted raven and expressed interest in producing for him while beckett had played on some of ravens previous albums raven said that he was unaware of becketts roles as a producer at the time and agreed to the offer after discovering that beckett had been a producer on several recordings of which he was a fan in advance of the albums release raven toured the southern united states with thenlabelmates alabamain 1988 producer jimmy bowen founded the independent country music label universal records and signed raven while the editors of the encyclopedia of country music stated that raven chose to end his contract with rca over poor record sales raven himself said at the time that bowen had recruited him for the thennew label after determining that his musical style would fit well among the other artists he had signed his initial release for the label was a cover of shakin stevens in a letter to you also written by dennis linde the song was the first release from his only universal album temporary sanity which came out in 1989 at bowens request beckett stayed on as ravens producer

miami sound machine in a letter to you was the first numberone single for the universal label achieving that position on billboard hot country songs along with the country music charts published by radio records and gavin report this was followed by his sixth and final numberone hit bayou boys which he wrote with myers and troy seals universal promoted raven and all the other acts on its roster through a multiartist performance hosted by charlie chase at fan fair now cma music festival in june 1989in december 1989 bowen closed the universal label to become president of capitol records nashville division to which raven and several other former universal artists were transferred following this transfer capitol would issue three more singles from temporary sanity first was sooner or later which was cowritten by husbandandwife team bill labounty and beckie foster and previously cut by the forester sisters on their album you again both this song and followup island placed within the top ten of hot country songs in 1990 but zydeco lady became his first single since 1979 not to reach top 40 on that chart jason ankeny of allmusic called the album a mixed bag referring to island as a moody ballad but calling the sound of bayou boys hamfisted billboard published a positive review of sooner or later which described it as a pounding rollicking number that should propel him back to those same chart heightsanother album for capitol nashville right for the flight followed in 1991 it accounted for two singles rock me in the rhythm of your love cowritten by robert earl keen and too much candy for a dime which were both unsuccessful on the charts also included on the album was cajun song which featured doug kershaw on duet vocals and accordion the ottawa citizen writer susan beyer reviewed the album with favor noting that it continued to display his cajun music influences while considering the latter half of the album weightier and more upbeat than the first half following the poor chart performance of the albums singles raven was dropped from capitols roster in september 1991his next album wild eyed and crazy was released on intersound records in 1994 the album included five new tracks plus rerecordings of eight of his previous singles the book musichound country described this album as an album of reworked hits that sound pretty much like they did originally supplemented by new decidedly lackluster material this was followed by cookin cajun a collaboration with fellow cajun country musician joel sonnier which was issued in 1996 the album included renditions of ravens im gon na get you and colinda along with sonniers tear stained letter and no more one more time music critic stephen thomas erlewine called it a goodnatured record that is a lot of fun while its playingwhile he continued to record independently capitol records retained the rights to works he had recorded under their tenure this culminated in the 1997 compilation 20 favorites consisting of singles album cuts and previouslyunreleased content the compilation included two singles johnnys got a pistol and somebodys tearin the flag the latter of which was previously found on right for the flight both of these songs drew minor media attention to raven as many radio stations took johnnys got a pistol out of rotation in the wake of various school shootings while the television network cmt refused to air the video for somebodys tearin the flag due to concerns that the song did not fit the networks intended programming demographics at the time raven felt that the songs failures were due to a preconception that artists of his age were not seen as suitable for mainstream country radio combined with concerns over political correctness despite the lack of radio and television success from the singles raven promoted them through performances at an american legion convention in chattanooga tennessee on flag day june 14 and as part of nashvilles independence day july 4 festivities also in 1997 the bellamy brothers featured both raven and sonnier on their single catahoulain 2001 raven released living in black white on the independent rmg records the album was produced by ron chancey and contributing writers included frank j myers earl thomas conley and lonestar lead vocalist richie mcdonald one of the songs on the album coldest fire was a song that raven had begun writing in 1987 at the encouragement of gant but found himself unable to finish for a long period following gants death that same year one single from the album cowboys dont cry

2011 album clancys tavern and made a cameo appearance at one of keiths concerts in july 2017 in 2018 raven released a bluegrass album called all grassed up which features a mix of new songs and rerecordings of existing material with accompaniment from the bluegrass band carolina roadravens musical style is defined largely by his strong influence of cajun music along with his lyricdriven songs and distinct vocal delivery according to raven he drew musical influence from his father who largely listened to country music but he also drew influence from the prominence of cajun music in his native louisiana an uncredited 1984 article in the tennessean stated that ravens style at the time was characterized by his emotive vocals and musical as well as lyrical hooks thomas goldsmith in the encyclopedia of country music wrote that ravens style was defined by direct soulful singing skillful songwriting and cajun heritage many of his songs have also displayed influences of reggae and caribbean music such as the reggaeinfluenced guitar riffs played by session guitarist reggie young on i shouldve called and the caribbean sway described by newport news daily press writer billy warden in a review of joe knows how to live joe edwards of the associated press said that raven has a deep masculine voice that pours out incisive songs in a style he describes as cajun reggae cajun caribbean electric cajun similarly susan beyer wrote in a review of right for the flight that is voice has a soulful edge with a nice strip of grit right in the middle and said that instead of whomping us from the first beats with accordions and cajun calls he finds the delicacy in the cajun legacyseveral of ravens compositions were successful for other artists among his early successes as a songwriter were four topten hits between 1971 and 1975 country green and touch the morning both by don gibson sometimes i talk in my sleep by randy cornor and i dont wan na talk it over anymore by

compilation also titled thank god for kids this consisted of singles and other material he had recorded while still on abc and was issued by mca records which had acquired abc in 1979 raven later said that the success of the oak ridge boys cut was a factor in his choosing to resume his career after his contract with elektra endedravens family lived in the maurice area and he graduated from maurice
