was dissatisfied with how dorsey burnette sang a version of it and offered it to guitar i said ill give up my royalties and everything just to do this song she told robinson in recounting their collaboration on dark moon to wayne jancik in the billboard book of onehit wonders i knew it was up for grabs and somebody was gon na get it i got it but he took me at my word and i really did give up my royalties it was one of the hardest things i ever put together ned wrote it but we tried in maybe five or six different ways in different studios before it came out right the final version consisted of just two guitars and a bass backing bonniethe song was originally issued under fabor records in 1956 dark moon was then issued over to dot records and by the spring of 1957 dark moon hit the pop top 10 list and went into the country top 15 listwhen bonnies rendition of dark moon hit the country and pop charts in the spring of 1957 she received recognition in the music business not only was she one of the few female country singers at the time but she was also one of the few country singers that had a hit on the country and pop charts at the same timeonly one other female country singer was achieving this type of crossover success guitar was having at the time which was patsy cline when her single walkin after midnight was a no 2 country hit and a no 12 pop hit at the same time dark moon brought guitar a wide audience and she was soon appearing on quite a few pop music programs similar to patsy cline bonnie could not followup her crossover success either her followup to dark moon called mister fire eyes failed to make a substantial impact on the pop charts making it only to no 71 there on the country charts though it was again a top 15 hit because she could not followup her crossover success her contract soon ended with dot records and guitar returned to washingtonguitar however decided she would form her very own record label called dolphin

with songs featuring themes about first sight through courting going steady threats from others getting engaged getting it broken off having the man marry someone else and finally having the woman live happily ever after on her own at the end unfortunately the original heyday of concept albums by the likes of frank sinatra and nat king cole had long since been over by 1964 and the new times for concept albums by the likes of the beatles and pink floyd were a few years off yet so the album was shelved even though the album was never released commercially in its original format a single was
