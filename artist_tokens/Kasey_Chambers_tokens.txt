two sets the captain and barricades brickwalls if only because she staked out her style on those sessions and here shes harvesting from the ground she broke earlier on but this also sounds like her most accomplished effort to datesingles from the album include hollywood august 2004 pony january 2005 and saturated may following the boxing day tsunami 26 december 2004 chambers appeared at the wave

for wayward angelchamberss fourth studio album carnival august 2006 also debuted at no 1 deming found is rootsfriendly enough that it isnt likely to seriously alienate most of her fans this album does represent a clear and decisive break from the countryinfluenced approach of her earlier music most of these 12 songs are easygoing but satisfying roots rock with a bluesy undertone as a songwriter she keeps getting better at writing about the stuff of everyday lives love lust disappointment getting on with life with an uncommon degree of horse sense and attention to detail and if anything the new musical backdrops have added to the depth of her emotional landscapes its lead single nothing at all july reached the top tenin april 2008 chambers issued her first collaboration album rattlin bones

liberation music which peaked at no 3 slant magazines jonathan keefe rated it as fouroutoffive stars and explained is a polished studioslick record of popcountry whose songs are catchy as all hell its the economy of songwriting that has been the source of the comparisons between her work and that of williams and chamberss deep understanding of song structure allows her to create real emotional complexity from just a few turns of phrase it won best country album at the aria awards in 2011storybook chambers next studio album was released in september 2011 and consists of cover versions of other artists material which peaked at no 21 no surf musics jason d hamad described how because of its very nature i cant say that this album breaks any new ground still it does justice to chambers sometimeseclectic influences and adds an additional layer of understanding for her fansher single from the album luka 2011 is a rendition of susan vegas original from 1987 hamad discussed how strips away the 80s synthpop replacing it with more traditional instrumentation including a prominent bouncing bass but keeps the airy musical feel meant to contrast with the dark tone of the lyrics her autobiography a little bird told me was coauthored with music journalist jeff apter and was issued later that yearher second collaboration with nicholson wreck ruin september 2012 reached no 6 and provided another aria award for best country album in the next year keefe found the album has the married couple layering intricate vocal harmonies over some casual mostly acoustic countryrock though

album which was not produced by her brother nash deming felt has written a set of songs that are unpretentiously intelligent but deal with matters of the heart and soul with unrelenting honesty and her rough sweet vocals never deliver anything short of the ring of truth is a strong satisfying album from one of the best and most distinctive singersongwriters of her day and this confirms she can move in any number of different directions and still offer her listeners something remarkableit was also recorded after her marital split from nicholson the previous year the musics chris familton observed it finds her canvassing a range of styles and moods often with religiousbiblical references without sacrificing her heartonsleeve emotiveness innate sense of melody and country heart the
