nomination for best female country vocal performance her last in that category jurek wrote that the album doesnt offer the deep reflective rewards of stones in the road nor is it quite as kinetic as come on come on despite this he thought that it was wellcrafted and considered let me into your heart to have influences of soul music after this album carpenter stated that she began to feel malaise toward the pace of her career as a result she deliberately scheduled fewer touring dates to allow herself more time spent with family and friends she also expressed disdain toward a place in the world as she felt her management had pressured her into making a commercially viable album instead of letting her choose songs she wanted to record as a result she hired a new manager ron fierstein who at the time was also serving in this capacity for colvin fierstein was supportive of carpenters decision to slow the pace of her career and encouraged her to focus on touring and selecting songs until she felt she was ready to make another albumin 1999 she released her first greatest hits album party doll and other favorites unlike most greatest hits packages this consisted mostly of live recordings curated from various concerts and television appearances throughout the 1990s it also included new studio recordings which carpenter and jennings produced with blake chancey the title track was a cover of mick jaggers party doll from his 1987 album primitive cool two of the new recordings almost home and wherever you are were issued as singles with the former becoming her last top40 country hit eli messinger of country standard time thought that the more uptempo tracks such as down at the twist and shout and shut up and kiss me showed just how much fun carpenter can be while overall praising the album for including the majority of her hit singlesher next columbia album was 2000s time sex love lead single simple life accounted for her last chart entry to date peaking at number 53 on hot country songs according to carpenter the asterisks in the title represented an abbreviation of its full name time is the great gift sex is the great equalizer love is the great

studio in london owned by george martin chancey once again assisted her and jennings on production duties she wrote every song on the album collaborating with kim richey gary burr and jennings on some tracks she also said that unlike with a place in the world she wanted to focus on making an album that she enjoyed instead of attempting to find songs which would be successful at radio throughout 2000 and 2001 she toured in both the united kingdom and the united states with steve earle joining her for the latter stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic said of the album that it found carpenter departing somewhat from her countryinflected sound and ruminating on relationships and career from a distinctly middleaged perspective john kenyon of the cedar rapids iowa gazette thought the album was wellproduced but considered it too long and lacking in musical variety during this albums corresponding tour carpenter underwent arthroscopic surgery for a knee injury and thus had to perform most of the concerts while seated she also told dave scheiber of the tampa bay times that while the albums songs were positively received in concert she was disappointed by the lack of radio play and questioned whether she still considered herself a country artistin 2002 carpenter joined emmylou harris bruce cockburn and patty griffin in a benefit concert for campaigning for a landmine free world

2004s between here and gone before its release she stated in an interview with national public radio npr that the title track was inspired by the death of songwriter dave carter other songs on the album were inspired by the emotions carpenter felt after the september 11 attacks for this album carpenter chose session pianist matt rollings to produce as she wanted to achieve a different production style than john jennings offered despite this jennings still played several instruments on the album other musicians included mac mcanally stuart duncan and viktor krauss the albums cover art was painted by atlanta georgiabased painter donna mintz who gave the original art to her as a gift and stated that she often listened to carpenters albums for inspiration jurek thought the album was a sophisticated but very accessible recording pleasant in its tempos and in its lush presentationafter leaving columbia records carpenter signed with the independent zoë records a division of rounder records in 2006 her first release for the label was 2007s the calling while it accounted for no charting singles the release reached number ten on the billboard country albums charts it was also nominated for the grammy award for best contemporary folk album in 2007 once again she wrote the entire album by herself and coproduced with rollings jurek thought the album had stronger rock music influences than its predecessors due to a heavier use of electric guitar and drums while saying of the albums lyrics that she has a hell of a way of looking at life from all sides shortly after the albums release carpenter was hospitalized for a pulmonary embolism which forced her to cancel all concert dates that year after being released from the hospital on april 27 2007 she issued a

city and the africanamerican spiritual children go where i send thee in addition to a number of songs she wrote herself jennings returned as producer for this project she stated that the two

throughout the 2010s with her next project being the age of miracles in 2010 many of the songs on this album were inspired by the emotions she felt after suffering her embolism particularly the impact it had on her touring and recording career at the time in particular she stated that the track iceland represented the feelings of loss and darkness and disconnection she felt while hospitalized and closing track the way i feel was about the resilience she felt after successfully recovering rollings coproduced and contributed on piano and hammond organ while dan dugmore played steel guitar and twelvestring guitar the album also featured duets with alison krauss and vince gill mark deming of allmusic wrote that the album was a literate and thoughtful set of songs that speak to the concerns of the heart and soul with equal portions of compassion and intelligence although he thought it might not appeal to fans of carpenters more uptempo work such as shut up and kiss me jonathan keefe of slant magazine was less favorable toward the album praising the lyrics of the title track and i put my ring back on but overall criticizing the albums sound as a pedestrian coffeehouse blend of hushed acoustic strumming in july 2010 carpenter performed i feel lucky at the grand ole opry before doing a concert at the tennessee performing arts center to promote the age of miracles throughout mid2011 she toured across the united states in support of this albumashes and roses followed on zoë in 2012 two personal life events influenced this albums songs the death of her father and her divorce from her husband james taylor provided duet vocals on the track soul companion jurek called this project the most confessional record of her career and praised the use of hammond organ and mandolin in the production allison stewart of the washington post wrote that it had woeful and beautiful coffeehouse folk songs decorated with sparing almost offhanded instrumentation that ’ s often limited to guitars and pianos keefe was less favorable toward the project criticizing carpenters hushed vocal tone and the lack of hooks her next project was 2013s songs from the movie a collaboration with composer and conductor vince mendoza this consisted of orchestral rerecordings of existing songs in her catalog after this albums 2014 release she performed selections from it with the bbc scottish symphony orchestra at the celtic connections festival in glasgow scotland writing for country standard time jeffrey b remz thought the album needed a bit more energy and veers decidedly towards the precious and pretty side but sometimes a bit too much so in 2014 carpenters touring schedule included a mix of orchestral performances comprising selections from songs from the movie as well as acoustic sets featuring jon carroll multiinstrumentalist john doyle and opening act tift merrittafter leaving the zoë label she began recording her next album in 2015 with production work from dave cobb this album the things that we are made of was released in 2016 via carpenters own lambent light records label with distribution rights by thirty tigers in addition to producing the album cobb played guitar moog synthesizer and mellotron something tamed something wild was selected as the lead single carpenter promoted the album with a number of dates throughout 2016 starting with a concert at wolf trap national park for the performing arts in washington dc that july carpenter said that she intentionally intended for her vocal tracks to be imperfect and that she had difficulty relinquishing control of production duties she also said that some of the songs were inspired by her walking her dog through the blue ridge mountains prior to the albums release npr streamed it online through its first listen program scott stroud of the associated press described cobbs production as elegant and considered it well suited to carpenters voice he also thought that carpenters lyrics showed an unexpectedly poignant turn of phrase also in 2015 longtime collaborator john jennings died of kidney cancernext on lambent light was 2018s sometimes just the sky this album consisted of rerecordings of tracks from each of her previous albums as well as the title track the only original composition english record producer ethan johns produced the project in addition to selecting all

awardscarpenter is credited as a writer on a number of songs for other artists these include cyndi laupers sallys pigeons wynonna judds girls with guitars trisha yearwoods where are you now and terri clarks no fearcarpenters music is defined by her folk music influences and lyrical focus erlewine wrote that carpenter found favor on country radio in the 1980s and 90s by taking her emotionally intelligent songs to a mass audience of her 1980s albums he stated that country radio was hesitant to play her soft folky feminist material but she received good reviews and airplay on more progressive country stations as well as college radio in the virgin encyclopedia of country music colin larkin noted the use of electric guitar in her more upbeat material such as passionate kisses and the hard way while also referring to house of cards as thoughtprovoking he also stated she together with the likes of trisha yearwood suzy bogguss and kathy mattea has brought fresh melody to an old and sometimes predictable genre larry katz of the red deer advocate contrasted her with yearwood and wynonna judd noting that unlike those artists carpenter usually wrote her songs herself instead of relying on nashvillebased songwriters alanna nash of entertainment weekly thought that by being a graduate of an ivy league college carpenter seemed the least likely female to go the distance on the country charts similarly katz thought that her upbringing was atypical of country music which is more commonly associated with demographics pertaining to the rural southern united statesnash also noted the difference between decidedly noncountry themes like halley ’ s comet and the spiritual life of old shirts in contrast to her more uptempo material such as down at the twist and shout in a review of stones in the road for the same publication browne contrasted that album with come on come on saying of the latter that her squarejawed voice leaner lyrics and the sturdyasawoodenfence folk rock combined to make a deservedbreakthrough he also said of her writing style that carpenter sounds like someone who sits down and thinks about it — a lot — before committing it to song not since the heyday of gordon lightfoot has a singersongwriter been so damn reasonable mike degagne of allmusic said of carpenters lyrics that she portray maturely the perils of romance and heartbreak from a female perspective writing for american songwriter deborah evans price noted themes of feminism due to many of her songs being about single women attempting to overcome setbacks in her life of this carpenter stated that ive just been kind of writing for me similarly nash stated that many of the songs on shooting straight in the dark featured women protagonists who take matters into their own hands eli messinger of country standard time described her singing voice as having empathic clarity and force particularly on passionate kisses and he thinks hell keep her he also stated that the former song had a theme of desire and the latter a call to selffulfillment keefe found influences of folk and country pop in her 1990s albums but thought that much of her work in the 21st century was mixed due to a lack of uptempo material and lyrical themes which he considered too similar to each other he described the stronger tracks on these albums as appealing to adult album alternative formatscarpenter was unmarried for most of her recording career in a 1994 profile dana kennedy of entertainment weekly referred to carpenter as a spokessinger for the thirtysomething single woman on june 1 2002 she married timmy smith a general contractor then working in batesville virginia actress sissy spacek and singer dave matthews were in attendance at the wedding by 2007 the couple lived on
