did not grow up around a lot of music in his home as he said his daddy didnt play an instrument but sometimes he would sing church music id hear him sing songs like man of constant sorrow pretty polly and omie wisei got my first banjo when i was a teenager i guess i was 15 16 years old my aunt had this old banjo and mother bought it for me paid 5 for it which back then was probably like 5000 had a little store and i remember my aunt took it out in grocerieshe learned to play the banjo clawhammer style from his mothershe had 11 brothers and sisters and all of them could play the fivestring banjo she played gatherings around the neighborhood like bean stringins she tuned it up for me and played this tune shout little luly and i tried to play it like she did but i think i developed my own style of the banjohe graduated from high school on may 2 1945 and was inducted into the army on may 16 serving for little more than a year when he got home he immediately began performing my daddy and carter picked me up from the station and carter was playing with another group roy sykes and the blue ridge mountain boys and they had a personal appearance that night so i sung a song with carter on the radio before i even got homeafter considering a course in veterinary he decided instead to join his older guitarplaying brother carter stanley 1925–1966 to form the clinch mountain boys in 1946 drawing heavily on the musical traditions of the area which included the unique singing style of the primitive baptist universalist church and the sweet downhome family harmonies of the carter family the two stanley brothers began playing on local radio stations they first performed at norton virginias wnva but did not stay long there moving on instead to bristol virginia and wcyb to start the show farm and fun time where they stayed off and on for 12 yearsat first they covered a lot of bill monroe music one of the first groups to pick up the new bluegrass format they soon found out that didnt pay off—we needed something of our own so we started writing songs in 1947 1948 i guess i wrote 20 or so banjo tunes but carter was a better writer than me when columbia records signed them as the stanley brothers monroe left in protest joining decca records later carter went back to sing for the father of bluegrass monroeralph stanley gave his opinion on bill monroes apparent change of heart he knew carter would make him a good singer bill monroe loved our music and loved our singingthe stanley brothers joined king records in the late 50s a record company which was so eclectic that it included james brown at the time in fact james brown and his band were in the studio when the stanley brothers recorded finger poppin time james and his band were poppin their fingers on that according to ralph at king records they went to a more stanley style the sound that people most know todayralph and carter performed as the stanley brothers with their band the clinch mountain boys from 1946 to 1966 ralph kept the band name when he continued as a solo act after carters death from 1967 until his death in 2016after carter died of complications of cirrhosis in 1966 after ailing for a year or so ralph stanley faced a hard decision on whether to continue performing on his own i was worried i didnt know if i could do it by myself but boy i got letters 3000 of em and phone calls i went to syd nathan at king and asked him if he wanted me to go on and he said hell yes you might be better than both of themhe decided to go it alone eventually reviving the clinch mountain boys larry sparks roy lee centers and charlie sizemore were among those with whom he played in the revived band he encountered ricky skaggs and keith whitley arriving late to his own show they were about 16 or 17 and they were holding the crowd til we got there they sounded just exactly like the stanley brothers seeing their potential he hired them to give em a chance though that meant a sevenmember band
