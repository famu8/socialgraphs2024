leland bill was thought to be too young for lessons but he began to play what he had heard during his brothers instruction and soon both were taking piano lessonsevans remembered leland with affection for not insisting on a heavy technical approach with scales and arpeggios he quickly developed a fluent sightreading ability but leland considered harry a better pianist at the age of seven bill began violin lessons and soon also flute and piccolo he soon dropped those instruments but it is believed they later influenced his keyboard style he later named mozart beethoven and schubert as composers whose work he often played during high school evans came in contact with 20thcentury music like stravinskys petrushka which he called a tremendous experience and milhauds suite provençale whose bitonal language he believed opened him to new things around the same time came his first exposure to jazz when at age 12 he heard tommy dorsey and harry jamess bands on the radio at age 13 bill stood in for a sick pianist in buddy valentinos rehearsal band where harry was already playing the trumpet soon he began to perform for dances and weddings throughout new jersey playing music like

plainfield high school graduating in 1946one night i got really adventurous on tuxedo junction and i put in a little ping you know that wasnt written and this was such an experience to make music that wasnt indicated that really got me into starting to want to think about how to make the musicinterview with harry evans c 1965i have always admired your teaching as that rare and amazing combination – exceptional knowledge combined with the ability to bring that same knowledge that lies deep within the student to life you were certainly my biggest inspiration in college and the seeds of the insights that you have sown have in practice borne fruit many times overbill evans talking about gretchen mageeafter high school in september 1946 evans attended southeastern louisiana college on a flute scholarship he studied classical piano interpretation with louis p kohnop john venettozzi and ronald stetzel a key figure in evanss development was gretchen magee whose methods of teaching left a big imprint on his compositional stylearound his third year in college evans composed his first known tune very early around that time he also composed a piece called peace piece years later when asked to play it he said it was a spontaneous improvisation and didnt know it he was a founding member of slus delta omega chapter of phi mu alpha sinfonia played quarterback for the fraternitys football team and played in the college band in 1950 he performed beethovens piano concerto no 3 on his senior recital graduating with a bachelor of music in piano and a bachelors in music education

radio station and occasionally performed in chicago clubs where he met singer lucy reed with whom he became friends and later recorded he met singer and bassist bill scott and chicago jazz pianist sam distefano his bunkmate in their platoon both of whom became evanss close friends evanss stay in the army was traumatic however and he had nightmares for years as people criticized his musical conceptions and playing he lost confidence for the first time around 1953 evans composed his bestknown tune waltz for debby for his young niece during this period he began using recreational drugs occasionally smoking marijuanaevans was discharged from the army in january 1954 and entered a period of seclusion triggered by the harsh criticism he had received he took a sabbatical year and lived with his parents where he set up a studio acquired a grand piano and worked on his technique believing he lacked the natural fluency of other musicians he visited his brother now in baton rouge

music composition he also wrote classical settings of poems by william blake along with his studies evans played in lowprofile tuxedo gigs at the friendship club and the roseland ballroom as well as jewish weddings intermission spots and over40 dances better opportunities also arose such as playing solo opposite the modern jazz quartet at the village vanguard where one day he saw miles davis listening to him during this period evans also met thelonious monkevans soon began to perform in greenwich village clubs with don elliott tony scott mundell lowe and bandleader jerry wald he may have played on some of walds discs but his first proven wald recording is listen to the music of jerry wald which also featured his future drummer paul motianin early 1955 singer lucy reed moved to new york city to play at the village vanguard and the blue angel and in august she recorded the singing reed with a fourpiece group that included evans during this period he met two of reeds friends manager helen keane who became his agent seven years later and george russell with whom he soon worked that year he recorded with guitarist dick garcia on a message from garcia for the dawn label in parallel evans kept up his work with scott playing in previews modern jazz club in chicago during december 1956–january 1957 and recording the complete tony scott after the complete sessions scott left for a long overseas tourin september 1956 producer orrin keepnews was convinced to record the reluctant evans by a demo tape mundell lowe played to him over the phone the result was his debut album new jazz conceptions featuring the original versions of waltz for debby and five eleven songs were recorded in the first session including evans original composition waltz for debby which would prove to be his most recognized and recorded composition the album began evanss relationship with riverside records and also marked the formation of the first bill evans trio with teddy kotick bass and paul motian drums allmusic critic scott yanow said about the album bill evans debut as a leader found the 27yearold pianist already sounding much different than the usual bud powellinfluenced keyboardists of the time a strong start to a rather significant career david rickert of all about jazz noted the influence of bud powell and wrote even at this stage he had the chops to make this a good piano jazz album but in the end its not a very good bill evans album there are glimpses of the later trademarks of evans style although a critical success that gained positive reviews in downbeat and metronome magazines new jazz conceptions was initially a financial failure selling only 800 copies the first year five was for some time evanss trio farewell tune during performances after the albums release evans spent much time studying j s bachs music to improve his techniqueit was one of those magic moments in your life when you expect a horror story and the doors of heaven open up i knew there and then he wasnt going to get awaygeorge russell upon hearing bill evans for the first timeevans met composer george russell during his tenure with lucy reed russells first impression of evans was negative this is going to be like pulling teeth all day but when he secretly heard evans play he completely changed his mind russell was then developing his magnum opus the treatise lydian chromatic concept of tonal organization in which he argued that the lydian mode was more compatible with tonality than the major scale used in most music this was groundbreaking in jazz and soon influenced musicians like miles davis evans who was already acquainted with these ideas began to work with russell in 1956by this time rca victor had begun a series of recordings called jazz workshop and soon russell through the intervention of hal mckusick and jack lewis gained his own record date titled the jazz workshop and released in 1957 at that time russell assembled trumpeter art farmer guitarist barry galbraith bassist milt hinton and bill evans on piano for three recording dates along with several rehearsal sessions initially for these sessions only the bassist was given a written part while the rest were left and according to farmer took the parts at home and tried to come to terms with them the album took a year to make and was successful enough to enable russell to escape his penurious lifestyle evans performed a significant solo in concerto for billy the kidin 1957 russell was one of six composers three jazz three classical brandeis university commissioned to write a piece for its festival of the creative arts in the context of the first experiments in third stream jazz russell wrote a suite for orchestra all about rosie that featured evans among other soloists all about rosie has been cited as one of the few convincing examples of composed polyphony in jazz a week before the festival the piece was previewed on tv and evanss performance was deemed legendary in jazz circles during the festival performance on june 6 evans became acquainted with chuck israels who became his bassist years later during the brandeis festival guitarist joe puma invited evans to play on the album joe pumajazzthat year evans also met bassist scott lafaro while auditioning him for a place in an ensemble led by trumpeter chet baker and was impressed lafaro joined his trio three years laterevans also performed on albums by charles mingus oliver nelson tony scott eddie costa and art farmerin february 1958 at miles daviss urging russell drove evans over to the colony club in brooklyn to play with davis sextet at this time john coltrane cannonball adderley paul chambers and philly joe jones were the other members of davis group red garland had recently been fired and evans knew he was not merely filling in for one night but auditioning to become the groups regular pianist by the end of the night davis told evans that he would be playing their next engagement in philadelphia the band had been known for playing a mixture of jazz standards and bebop originals but by the time evans arrived davis had begun his venture into modal jazz having just released his album milestonesevans formally joined the miles davis group in april 1958 the band appeared in radio broadcasts on saturday nights and on may 3 the new formation made its first broadcast from café bohemia its usual locale the live radio appearance that was broadcast on may 17 1958 and also released on the album titled makin wax is known as the earliest documented evidence of the collaboration between bill evans and miles davis by midmay jimmy cobb replaced philly joe jones with whom evans had developed a close friendship on may 26 evans made his first studio recordings with davis which were first issued as part of jazz track and later reissued on 1958 milesa performance of the ballets africains from guinea in 1958 sparked davis interest in modal music this music stayed for long periods of time on a single chord weaving in and out of consonance and dissonance another influence was george russells treatise both influences coalesced in davis conception of modal jazz offering an alternative to chord changes and majorminor key relationships relying instead on a series of modal scales he realized that evans who had worked with russell could follow him into modal music at the same time evans introduced davis to twentiethcentury classical composers such as sergei rachmaninoff maurice ravel and aram khachaturianthe bands mostly black followers did not react favourably to the replacement of garland with a white musician davis used to tease him and evanss sensitivity perhaps let it get to him however the band began to find a new smoother groove as adderley recalled when he started to use bill miles changed his style from very hard to a softer approachbill had this quiet fire that i loved on piano the way he approached it the sound he got was like crystal notes or sparkling water cascading down from some clear waterfall i had to change the way the band sounded again for bills style by playing different tunes softer ones at firstmiles davisin july 1958 evans appeared as a sideman on adderleys album portrait of cannonball featuring the first performance of nardis specially written by davis for the session while davis was not very satisfied with the performance he said that from then on evans was the only one to play it in the way he wanted the piece came to be associated with evanss future trios which played it frequentlyby the end of the summer davis knew evans was quickly approaching his full professional development and that he would soon decide to leave davis group this year evans won the downbeat international critics poll for his work with davis and his album new jazz conceptionsin september 1958 evans recorded as a sideman in art farmers album modern art also featuring benny golson all three had won the downbeat poll later evans deemed this record as one of his favorites during this period despite all the successes evans was visiting a psychiatrist as he was unsure whether he wanted to continue as a pianistevans left davis sextet in november 1958 and stayed with his parents in florida and his brother in louisiana while he was burned out one of the main reasons for leaving was his fathers illness during this sojourn the always selfcritical evans suddenly felt his playing had improved while i was staying with my brother in baton rouge i remember finding that somehow i had reached a new level of expression in my playing it had come almost automatically and i was very anxious about it afraid i might lose itshortly after he moved back to new york and in december evans recorded the trio album everybody digs bill evans for riverside records with bassist sam jones and drummer philly joe jones this was evanss second album as a leader the first since new jazz conceptions recorded two years earlier while producer orrin keepnews had many times tried to persuade evans to make a second trio recording the pianist felt he had nothing new to say until then he had also been too busy traveling with davis to make a recordone of the pieces to appear on the album was leonard bernsteins some other time evans started to play an introduction using an ostinato figure however according to keepnews who was present the pianist spontaneously started to improvise over that harmonic frame creating the recording that would be named peace piece according to evans what happened was that i started to play the introduction and it started to get so much of its own feeling and identity that i just figured well ill keep going however gretchen magee claims that the piece had been penned as an exercise during his college years while peri cousins says that he would often play the piece at homeevans returned to the davis sextet in early 1959 at the trumpeters request to record kind of blue often considered the bestselling jazz album of all timeas usual during the sessions of kind of blue miles davis called for almost no rehearsal and the musicians had little idea what they were to record davis had given the band only sketches of scales and melody lines on which to improvise once the musicians were assembled davis gave brief instructions for each piece and then set about taping the sextet in studioduring the creative process of kind of blue davis handed evans a piece of paper with two chords—g minor and a augmented—and asked what would you do with that evans spent the next night writing what would become blue in green however when the album came out the song was attributed exclusively to davis when evans suggested he might deserve a share of the royalties davis offered him a check for 25 evans also penned the liner notes for kind of blue comparing jazz improvisation to japanese visual art by the fall of 1959 evans had started his own trio with jimmy garrison and kenny dennis but it was shortlivedsometime during the late 1950s most probably before joining miles davis evans began using heroin philly joe jones has been cited as an especially bad influence in this aspect although davis seems to have tried to help evans kick his addiction he did not succeedevanss first longterm romance was with a black woman named peri cousins for whom peris scope was named during the second half of the 1950s the couple had problems booking in hotels during evanss gigs since most of them did not allow interracial couples by the turn of the decade evans had met a waitress named ellaine schultz who would become his partner for twelve yearswe needed people that were interested in each other so that we could spend a year or two just growing without ambitions just allowing the music to grow and allowing our talents to merge in a very natural wayevans in interview with george clabin 1966in mid1959 evans was performing at basin street east and was visited by bassist scott lafaro who was playing with singer and pianist bobby scott at a club around the corner lafaro expressed interest in forming a trio and suggested paul motian who had appeared on evanss album new jazz conceptions as the drummer for the new group the trio with lafaro and motian became one of the most celebrated piano trios in jazz with this group evanss focus settled on traditional jazz standards and original compositions with an added emphasis on interplay among band members evans and lafaro would achieve a high level of musical empathy in december 1959 the band recorded its first album portrait in jazz for riverside recordsin early 1960 the trio began a tour that brought them to boston san francisco at jazz workshop and chicago at the sutherland lounge after returning to new york in february the band performed at town hall on a multiartist bill and then began a residency at birdland while the trio did not produce any studio records in 1960 two bootleg recordings from radio broadcasts from april and may were illegally released in the early 1970s which infuriated evans later they would be posthumously issued as the 1960 birdland sessionsin parallel with his trio work evans kept working as a backing musician for other bandleaders in 1960 he performed on singer frank minions album the soft land of make believe featuring versions of the kind of blue compositions flamenco sketches and so what with added lyrics that year he also recorded the soul of jazz percussion with philly joe jones and chambersin may 1960 the trio performed at one of the jazz profiles concerts a series organized by charles schwartz around this time evans hired monte kay as his manager during one of his concerts at the jazz gallery evans contracted hepatitis and went to his parents house in florida to recuperate during this time period evans also participated in the recordings the great kai j j and the incredible kai winding trombones for impulse records in may and august 1960 evans appeared on george russells album jazz in the space age in late 1960 he performed on jazz abstractions an album recorded under the leadership of gunther schuller and john lewisevans trio with motian and lafaro recorded explorations in february 1961 the groups second and final studio album according to orrin keepnews the atmosphere during the recording sessions was tense evans and lafaro having had an argument over extramusical matters additionally evans was suffering at the session from headaches and lafaro was playing with a loaned bass the disc features the evans first trio version of nardis the miles davis piece evans had recorded with cannonball adderley for adderleys portrait of cannonball album in 1958 apart from nardis and elsa the album consisted of jazz standards after the recording sessions evans was initially unwilling to release the album believing the trio had played badly however upon hearing the recording he changed his mind and later thought of it in very positive terms in february 1961 shortly after the explorations sessions he appeared as a sideman in oliver nelsons the blues and the abstract truthin late june 1961 riverside recorded evans trio live at the village vanguard which resulted in the albums sunday at the village vanguard and waltz for debby further recordings from this performance were issued in 1984 as more from the vanguard evans later showed special satisfaction with these recordings seeing them as the culmination of the musical interplay of his triothe death of 25yearold lafaro in a car accident ten days after the vanguard performances devastated evans he did not record or perform in public again for several monthsin october 1961 persuaded by his producer orrin keepnews evans returned to the musical scene on the mark murphy album rah with new bassist chuck israels they recorded in december a session for nirvana with flautist herbie mann in april and may 1962 evans completed the duo album undercurrent with guitarist jim hallwhen he reformed his trio in 1962 two albums moon beams and how my heart sings resulted in 1963 at the beginning of his association with verve he recorded conversations with myself an album which featured overdubbing layering up to three individual tracks of piano for each song the album won him his first grammy awardevanss heroin addiction increased following lafaros death his girlfriend ellaine schultz was also an addict evans habitually had to borrow money from friends and eventually his electricity and telephone services were shut down evans said you dont understand its like death and transfiguration every day you wake in pain like death and then you go out and score and that is transfiguration each day becomes all of life in microcosmevans never allowed heroin to interfere with his musical discipline according to a 2010 bbc record review article which contrasts evanss addiction with that of chet baker on one occasion while injecting heroin evans hit a nerve and temporarily disabled it performing a full weeks engagement at the village vanguard virtually onehanded during this time helen keane began having an important influence as she gave significant assistance helping to maintain evanss career despite his selfdestructive lifestyle and the two developed a strong friendshipin summer 1963 evans and schultz left their flat in new york and settled in his parents home in florida where it seems they quit the habit for some time even though never legally married bill and ellaine were in all other respects husband and wife at that time schultz meant everything to evans and was the only person with whom he felt genuine comfortalthough he recorded many albums for verve their artistic quality has typically been viewed as uneven despite israels fast development and the creativity of new drummer larry bunker the album bill evans trio with symphony orchestra featuring gabriel faurés pavane and works of other classical composers arranged by claus ogerman divided critical opinion some recordings in unusual contexts were made such as a concert recording with a bigband recorded at town hall new york that was never issued owing to evanss dissatisfaction with it although the more successful jazz trio portion of the concert was released live recordings and bootleg radio broadcasts from this time period represent some of the trios better workin 1965 the trio with chuck israels and larry bunker went on a wellreceived european tourin 1966 bill evans met puertorico born juilliardgraduated bassist eddie gómez in what turned out to be an elevenyear stay gómez sparked new developments in evanss trio conception one of the most significant releases during this period is bill evans at the montreux jazz festival 1968 which won him his second grammy award it has remained a critical favorite and is one of two albums evans made with drummer jack dejohnetteother highlights from this period include solo – in memory of his father from bill evans at town hall 1966 which also introduced turn out the stars a second pairing with guitarist jim hall intermodulation 1966 and the solo album alone 1968 featuring a 14minute version of never let me go that won his third grammy awardin 1968 drummer marty morell joined the trio and remained until 1975 when he retired to family life this was evanss most stable longestlasting group evans had overcome his heroin habit and was entering a period of personal stabilitybetween 1969 and 1970 evans recorded from left to right featuring his first use of electric pianobetween may and june 1971 evans recorded the bill evans album which won two grammy awards this alloriginals album four new also featured alternation between acoustic and electric piano one of these was comrade conrad a tune that had originated as a crest toothpaste jingle and had later been reelaborated and dedicated to conrad mendenhall a friend who had died in a car accidentother albums included the tokyo concert 1973 since we met 1974 and but beautiful 1974 released in 1996 featuring the trio plus saxophonist stan getz in live performances from the netherlands and belgium morell was an energetic straightahead drummer unlike many of the trios former percussionists and many critics feel that this was a period of little growth for evans after morell left evans and gómez recorded two duo albums intuition and montreux iiiin the early 1970s evans was caught at new yorks john f kennedy international airport with a suitcase containing heroin although the police put him in jail for the night he was not charged however both he and ellaine had to begin methadone treatmentin 1973 while working in redondo beach california evans met and fell in love with nenette zazzara despite his longterm relationship with ellaine schultz when evans broke the news to schultz she pretended to understand but then committed suicide by throwing herself under a subway train evanss relatives believe that schultzs infertility coupled with bills desire to have a son may have influenced those events as a result evans went back on heroin for a while before resuming methadone treatment in august 1973 evans married nenette and in 1975 they had a child evan the new family which also included evanss stepdaughter maxine lived in a large house in closter new jersey both remained very close until his death nenette and bill remained married until evanss death in 1980in 1974 bill evans recorded a multimovement jazz concerto written for him by claus ogerman entitled symbiosisthere is an intriguing juxtaposition of opposites running through the music—bennett the expansive heart on sleeve vibrato man evans the inward looking aesthete—which makes for charged listening if charged is an adjective which can be applied to something so relaxed and the projects were genuinely collaborative with the artists on an equal footing evans solos wonderfully throughout and together again actually starts with a solo piano piece the bad and the beautiful put there at bennetts suggestion to emphasize that this wasnt just a vocalistwithaccompanist affair by the time bennett and evans made the second album theyd been performing live together for a year and their partnership comfortable enough though it was on the first album is noticeably better oiled— chris may on the complete tony bennettbill evans recordingsduring the mid1970s bill evans collaborated with the singer tony bennett on two critically acclaimed albums the tony bennettbill evans album 1975 and together again 1977it was tony bennett who initiated the collaboration with bill evans the two musicians had mutual respect for each others talent bennett and evans performed together for about two years although evans was using cocaine regularly during this period he was reported sober when recording the albums with bennettboth bennett and evans stated that it was not just a singer with accompanist affair but rather a mutually stimulated creative effort to enhance some well known hits with a new twist on familiar melodies and harmonies harmonically sophisticated piano arrangements by evans and his extended piano solos were encouraged by bennett to emphasize equally valuable input from both musiciansbennett and evans recorded the first album in four studio sessions in june 1975 and the second album in four studio sessions in september 1976 between the two recordings bennett and evans performed live as a duo featuring songs from their recordings including but beautiful days of wine and roses dream dancingin 1975 morell was replaced by drummer eliot zigmund several collaborations followed and it was not until 1977 that the trio was able to record an album together both i will say goodbye evanss last album for fantasy records and you must believe in spring for warner bros highlighted changes that would become significant in the last stage of evanss life a greater emphasis was placed on group improvisation and interaction and new harmonic experiments were attemptedgómez and zigmund left evans in 1978 evans then asked philly joe jones the drummer he considered his alltime favorite drummer to fill in several bassists were tried with michael moore staying the longest evans finally settled on marc johnson on bass and joe labarbera on drums this trio would be evanss lastin april 1979 evans met laurie verchomin a canadian waitress later a writer with whom he had a relationship until his death verchomin was 28 years youngerat the beginning of a severalweek tour of the trio through the pacific northwest in the spring of 1979 evans learned that his brother harry who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia had died by suicide at age52 this news shocked him deeply and some of the concerts had to be canceled his friends and relatives believe that this event precipitated his own death the following yearmarc johnson recalled this fateful trip marks the beginning of the end bills willingness to play and work decreased noticeably after the death of harry actually it was just the music itself that held him upright he fulfilled his obligations because he needed money but these were the few moments in his life when he felt comfortable—the times in between must have been depressing and he barely showed a willingness to livein august 1979 evans recorded his last studio album we will meet again featuring a composition of the same name written for his brother the album won a grammy award posthumously in 1981 along with i will say goodbyeduring the late 1970s evans kicked his heroin habit with the help of methadone only to become addicted to cocaine he started with one gram per weekend but later started taking several grams daily his brother harrys suicide may have also influenced his emotional state after 1979 his sisterinlaw pat evans has stated that she knew bill would not last long after harrys death and she wondered if that is what prompted her to buy three plots in a baton rouge cemetery where harry was interred it has been documented that he voluntarily quit his treatment for chronic hepatitis laurie verchomin has said that evans was clear in mind that he would die in a short timeon september 15 1980 evans who had been in bed for several days with stomach pains at his home in fort lee was accompanied by joe labarbera and verchomin to the mount sinai hospital in new york city where he died that afternoon the cause of death was a combination of peptic ulcer cirrhosis bronchial pneumonia and untreated hepatitis evanss friend gene lees described evanss struggle with drugs as the longest suicide in historyhe was interred in baton rouge next to his brother harry services were held in manhattan on friday september 19 a tribute planned by producer orrin keepnews and tom bradshaw was held on the following monday september 22 at the great american music hall in san francisco fellow musicians paid homage to the late pianist in the first days of the 1980 monterey jazz festival which had opened that very week dave brubeck played his own in your own sweet way on the 19th the manhattan transfer would follow on the 20th while john lewis dedicated ill remember april in 1981 pat metheny and lyle mays released the piece september fifteenth dedicated to bill evans on their album as falls wichita so falls wichita fallsbill evans is credited with influencing the harmonic language of jazz piano evanss harmony was itself influenced by impressionist composers such as claude debussy and maurice ravelhis versions of jazz standards as well as his own compositions often featured thorough reharmonisations musical features included added tone chords modal inflections unconventional substitutions and modulationsone of evanss distinctive harmonic traits is excluding the root in his chords leaving this work to the bassist played on another beat of the measure or just left implied if i am going to be sitting here playing roots fifths and full voicings the bass is relegated to a time machine this idea had already been explored by ahmad jamal erroll garner and red garland in evanss system the chord is expressed as a quality identity and a color most of evanss harmonies feature added note chords or quartal voicings thus evans created a selfsufficient language for the left hand a distinctive voicing that allowed the transition from one chord to the next while hardly having to move the hand with this technique he created an effect of continuity in the central register of the piano lying around middle c in this region the harmonic clusters sounded the clearest and at the same time left room for contrapuntal independence with the bassevanss improvisations relied heavily on motivic development either melodically or rhythmically motives may be broken and recombined to form melodies another characteristic of evanss style is rhythmic displacement his melodic contours often describe arches other characteristics include sequenciation of melodies and transforming one motive into another he plays with one hand in the time signature of 44 and the other momentarily in 34at the beginning of his career evans used block chords heavily he later abandoned them in partduring a 1978 interview marian mcpartland askedat least during his late years evanss favorite keys to play in were a and e evans greatly valued bachs music which influenced his playing style and which helped him gain good touch and finger independence bach changed my hand approach to playing the piano i used to use a lot of finger technique when i was younger and i changed over to a weight technique actually if you play bach and the voices sing at all and sustain the way they should you really cant play it with the wrong approach evans valued bachs the welltempered clavier and his two and threepart inventions as excellent practice materialin an interview with len lyons evans said for me technique is the ability to translate your ideas into sound through your instrumentin an interview given in 1964 evans described bud powell as his single greatest influence biographer peter pettinger notes that evans assimilated a thousand influences including pianists such as dave brubeck george shearing oscar peterson al haig and lou levy as well as horn players such as miles davis dizzy gillespie charlie parker and stan getz the biggest influence on evans though was the pianism of nat king cole whom evans called one of the tastiest and just swinginest and beautifully melodic improvisers and jazz pianists that jazz has ever known and he was one of the very first that really grabbed me hard pettinger also notes that the work of the pianist lennie tristano with his cool approach to a line was an important influence on evans and lyons observes that tristano preceded evans in his use of overdubbing piano tracks in addition evans was heavily influenced by his indepth studies of european classical music the constructional knowledge of music that evans later brought to jazz was firmly rooted in this european tradition as was his thoroughly trained and exquisitely refined touch at the keyboardas a composer evans also assimilated and amalgamated jazz popular and classical influences in an utterly logical manner his compositional style shows similarities to and influences from some of the composers whose works he often played such as earl zindars and michel legrand j william murray notes that evans was very adept at drawing western european compositional techniques into jazz and there are elements of bach chopin debussy and ravel in his writingevanss career began just before the rock explosion in the 1960s during this decade jazz was swept into a corner and most new talents had few opportunities to gain recognition especially in america however evans believed he had been lucky to gain some exposure before this profound change in the music world and never had problems gaining bookings and recording opportunitiesevans never embraced new music movements he kept his style intact for example he lamented watching davis shift his style towards jazz fusion and blamed the change on considerations of commerce evans commented i would like to hear more of the consummate melodic master but i feel that big business and his record company have had a corrupting influence on his material the rock and pop thing certainly draws a wider audience it happens more and more these days that unqualified people with executive positions try to tell musicians what is good and what is bad music however evans and davis kept in touch throughout their liveswhile evans considered himself an acoustic pianist from the 1970 album from left to right on he also released some material with fenderrhodes piano intermissions however unlike other jazz players such as herbie hancock he never fully embraced the new instrument and invariably ended up returning to the acoustic sound i dont think too much about the electronic thing except that its kind of fun to have it as an alternate voice merely an alternate keyboard instrument that offers a certain kind of sound thats appropriate sometimes i find that its a refreshing auxiliary to the piano—but i dont need it i dont enjoy spending a lot of time with the electric piano i play it for a period of time then i quickly tire of it and i want to get back to the acoustic piano he commented that electronic music just doesnt attract me im of a certain period a certain evolution i hear music differently for me comparing electric bass to acoustic bass is sacrilegeevanss repertoire consisted of established jazz standards songs by contemporaries some of which he helped become standards and original compositions some of which have also gone on to become standards among the major american songwriters he was particularly drawn to the work of jimmy van heusen recording what was reputedly his favorite song but beautiful many times in various settings as well as many other tunes by van heusen contemporaries whose works he often played include michel legrand johnny mandel and earl zindars as well as to a lesser extent burt bacharach john lewis henry mancini gary mcfarland thelonious monk claus ogerman steve swallow and denny zeitlin other songs by his contemporaries and colleagues he recorded include in your own sweet way by dave brubeck youre gon na hear from me by andré previn the peacocks by jimmy rowles dolphin dance by herbie hancock and atypically i do it for your love by paul simon which nonetheless continued to inspire the pianists most complex thoughts in his final years nardis by miles davis was a special signature tune often performed in highly extended versions by his final trioduring a radio interview marian mcpartland listened to evans play reflections in d by duke ellington and later noted sitting next to him listening to the rise and fall of the melody i realized that he chooses some of the most romantic evocative tunes there are the tune ended softly with a chord so perfect it took my breath awayevans composed over 50 originals many were dedicated to people close to him some known examples include waltz for debby for his niece for nenette for his wife letter to evan for his son nycs no lark an anagram of sonny clark in memory of his friend the pianist re person i knew another anagram of the name of his friend and producer orrin keepnews we will meet again for his brother peris scope for girlfriend peri cousins one for helen and song for helen for his manager helen keane b minor waltz for ellaine for girlfriend ellaine schultz laurie for girlfriend laurie verchomin yet neer broken an anagram of the name of cocaine dealer robert kenney maxine for his stepdaughter tiffany for joe labarberas daughter and knit for mary f for fan mary franksen from omahabill evans was an avid reader in particular philosophy and humorous books his shelves held works by plato voltaire whitehead santayana freud margaret mead sartre and thomas merton and he had a special fondness for thomas hardys work he was fascinated with eastern religions and philosophies including islam zen and buddhism it was evans who introduced john coltrane to the indian philosophy of krishnamurtievans liked to paint and draw he was also a keen golfer a hobby that began on his fathers golf course evans had a fondness for horse racing and frequently gambled hundreds of dollars often winning during his last years he even owned a racehorse named annie hall with producer jack rollinsin 1973 evans broke up with his girlfriend of twelve years ellaine schultz to pursue nenette zazzara schultz then committed suicide by throwing herself in front of a subway trainevans married zazzara in august 1973 they met while bills trio was performing at howard rumseys club concerts by the sea in redondo beach california where zazzara was a parttime waitressmusic critic richard s ginell wrote with the passage of time bill evans has become an entire school unto himself for pianists and a singular mood unto himself for listeners there is no more influential jazzoriented pianist—only mccoy tyner exerts nearly as much pull among younger players and journeymenduring his short tenure with davis in 1958 when the band left new york to go on the road evans sometimes received cold receptions from the mostly black audiences evans later acknowledged that some felt his presence threatened the black pride aspect of the famed davis bands success pettinger believed in a recording for his solo on a tune named walkin evans received noticeably less applause than the other soloists and for that on all of you none at all davis and the other band members would respond hes supposed to be there miles wants him there on the bandstand whenever audience members made comments davis noted in his autobiography that evans was sensitive to the criticism and let it get to him this might have been a contributing factor to evans leaving the band after just seven monthswhen ken burns television miniseries jazz was released in 2001 it was criticised for neglecting evanss work after his departure from the miles davis sextetauthor and jazz pianist len lyons wrote evans was the most influential pianist of the 1960s the tone touch texture and harmonic richness of his playing affected the majority of pianists who followed him evans has left his mark on such players as herbie hancock chick corea paul bley keith jarrett steve kuhn warren bernhardt michel petrucciani john taylor vince guaraldi stefano bollani don friedman marian mcpartland denny zeitlin bobo stenson fred hersch bill charlap lyle mays eliane elias diana krall ralph towner john mclaughlin lenny breau rick wright of pink floyd denis matsuev and many other musicians in jazz and other music genres his recordings have been transcribed and arranged by jed distler and others and recorded by classical musicians such as the kronos quartet jeanyves thibaudet roy eaton and igor levitevanss piano style has also influenced some contemporary classical composers the noted hungarian composer györgy ligeti admired evans and acknowledged his influence in an interview adding as far as touch is concerned bill evans is a sort of michelangeli of jazz in reference to the great classical pianist arturo benedetti michelangeli ligetis fifth piano étude subtitled arcenciel rainbow demonstrates this influence clearly and ligeti even handwrote in the margin of the score play it like bill evans likewise american minimalist composer and keyboardist terry riley included evans in the pantheon of my teachers and heroes in the liner notes to his solo piano lisbon concertmany of evanss own compositions such as waltz for debby peace piece blue in green very early time remembered turn out the stars we will meet again and funkallero have become oftenrecorded jazz standards in addition his early death inspired the composition
