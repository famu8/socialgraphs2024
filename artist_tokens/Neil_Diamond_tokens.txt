he attended erasmus hall high school and was a member of the freshman chorus and choral club along with classmate barbra streisand 155 diamond recalled they were not close friends at the time we were two poor kids in brooklyn we hung out in the front of erasmus high and smoked cigarettes also in their class was chess grandmaster bobby fischer after his family moved to brighton beach he attended abraham lincoln high school and was a member of the fencing team also on the team was his best friend future olympic fencer herb cohenfor his 16th birthday he received his first guitar when he was 16 and still in high school diamond spent a number of weeks at surprise lake camp 21 a camp for jewish children in upstate new york when folk singer pete seeger performed a small concert seeing the widely recognized singer perform and watching other children singing songs for seeger that they wrote themselves had an immediate effect on diamond who then became aware of the possibility of writing his own songs and the next thing i got a guitar when we got back to brooklyn started to take lessons and almost immediately began to write songs he said he added that his attraction to songwriting was the first real interest he had growing up while also helping him release his youthful frustrationsdiamond also used his newly developed skill to write poetry by writing poems for girls he was attracted to in school he soon learned it often won their hearts his male classmates took note and began asking him to write poems for them which they would sing and use with equal success 10 he spent the summer after graduation working as a waiter in the catskills resort area there he first met jaye posner who would years later become his wife 26 diamond next attended new york university as a premed major on a fencing scholarship again on the fencing team with herb cohen he was a member of the 1960 ncaa mens championship fencing team often bored in class he found writing song lyrics more to his liking he began cutting classes and taking the train up to tin pan alley where he tried to get some of his songs heard by local music publishers in his senior year when he was just 10 units short of graduation sunbeam music publishing offered him a 16week job writing songs for 50 a week equivalent to about 510 per week in 2023 and he dropped out of college to accept itdiamond was not rehired after his 16 weeks with sunbeam and he began writing and singing his own songs for demos i never really chose songwriting he says it just absorbed me and became more and more important in my life his first recording contract was billed as neil and jack an everly brotherstype duet with high school friend jack packer they recorded the unsuccessful singles you are my love at last with what will i do and im afraid with till youve tried love both records released in 1962 cashbox and billboard magazines gave all four sides positive reviews and diamond signed with columbia records as a solo performer later in 1962 in july 1963 columbia released the single clown town at night billboard gave a laudatory review to clown town and cashbox was complimentary to both sides but it still failed to make the charts columbia dropped him from their label and he went back to writing songs in and out of publishing houses for the next seven yearsdiamond wrote wherever he could including on buses and used an upright piano above the birdland club in new york city one of the causes of this early nomadic life as a songwriter was his songs wordiness id spent a lot of time on lyrics and they were looking for hooks and i didnt really understand the nature of that he says he was able to sell only about one song a week during those years barely enough to survive he found himself only earning enough to spend 35 cents a day on food equivalent to 3 in 2023 but the privacy that he had above the birdland club allowed him to focus on writing without distractions something new began to happen i wasnt under the gun and suddenly interesting songs began to happen songs that had things none of the others did among them were cherry cherry and solitary man solitary man was the first record that diamond recorded under his own name which made the charts it remains one of his personal favorites as it was about his early years as a songwriter even though he failed to realize it at the time he describes the song as an outgrowth of my despair 37 diamond spent his early career in the brill building his first success as a songwriter came in november 1965 with sunday and me a top 20 hit for jay and the americans greater success followed with im a believer a little bit me a little bit you look out here comes tomorrow and love to love all performed by the monkees he wrote and recorded the songs for himself but the other versions were released before his own the unintended consequence was that diamond began to gain fame as a songwriter im a believer became a gold record within two days of its release and stayed at the top of the charts for seven weeks making it the popular music song of the year in 1966 44 and the grass wont pay no mind brought covers from elvis presley who also interpreted sweet caroline and mark lindsay former lead singer for paul revere the raiders other notable artists who recorded his early songs were lulu cliff richard and the english hardrock band deep purplein 1966 diamond signed a deal with bert bernss bang records then a subsidiary of atlantic his first release on that label was solitary man which was his first true hit as a solo artist diamond followed with cherry cherry and kentucky woman 37 his early concerts featured him opening for bands such as hermans hermits and the who 45 as a guest performer with the who he was shocked to see pete townshend swinging his guitar like a club and then throwing it against walls and off the stage until the instruments neck broke 46 diamond began to feel restricted by bang records because he wanted to record more ambitious introspective music such as brooklyn roads starting in 1968 berns wanted to release kentucky woman as a single but diamond was no longer satisfied writing simple pop songs so he proposed shilo which was not about the civil war but rather an imaginary childhood friend bang believed that the song was not commercial enough so it was relegated to being an lp track on just for you diamond was also dissatisfied with his royalties and tried to sign with another record label after discovering a loophole in his contract that did not bind him exclusively to either web iv or tallyrand but the result was a series of lawsuits that coincided with a slump in his record sales and professional success a magistrate refused web ivs request for a temporary injunction to prevent diamond from joining another record company while his contract dispute continued in court but the lawsuits persisted until february 1977 when he triumphed in court and purchased the rights to his bangera master tapes 51 in march 1968 diamond signed a deal with uni records the label was named after universal pictures the owner of which mca inc later consolidated its labels into mca records now called universal music after merging with polygram in 1999 his debut album for unimca was in late 1968 with velvet gloves and spit produced by tom catalano which did not chart and he recorded the early 1969 followup brother loves traveling salvation show at american sound studios in memphis with tommy cogbill and chips moman producingin mid 1969 diamond moved to los angeles his sound mellowed with such songs as sweet caroline 1969 holly holy 1969 cracklin rosie 1970 and song sung blue 1972 the last two reaching no 1 on the hot 100 sweet caroline was diamonds first major hit after his slump in 2007 diamond said he had written sweet caroline for caroline kennedy after seeing her on the cover of life in an equestrian riding outfit but in 2014 he said in an interview on the today show that it was written for his then wife marcia he could not find a good rhyme with the name marcia and so used the name caroline it took him just one hour in a memphis hotel to write and compose it the 1971 release i ami said was a top 5 hit in both the us and uk and was his most intensely personal effort to date taking over four months to completein 1971 diamond played seven soldout concerts at the greek theater in los angeles the outdoor theater which was noted for showcasing the best of current entertainers added a stereo sound system for the first time diamond was also backed by a 35piece string orchestra and six backing singers 86 after the first night one leading newspaper called it the finest concert in greek theater history 87 i have a lovehate relationship with songwriting i love it because its so satisfyingwhen it works i hate it because it forces you to dig inside yourself it is without question the most difficult thing i doperforming on the other hand is the most joyful and happiest thing i do the bigger the audience the more anticipation the more excitementneil diamond 1977in august 1972 he played again at the greek this time doing ten shows when the show was first announced tickets at the 5000seat theater sold out rapidly 93 he added a quadraphonic sound system for his performance to create full surround sound the performance of august 24 1972 was recorded and released as the live double album hot august night diamond recalled hot august night captures a very special show for me we went all out to really knock em dead in la 93 many consider it his best work critic stephen thomas erlewine called hot august night the ultimate neil diamond record diamond the icon in full glory the album became a classic and was remastered in 2000 with additional selections in australia which at the time was said to have the most neil diamond fans per capita of any country 94 the album ranked no 1 for 29 weeks and stayed in their top 20 bestsellers for two years 94 in the fall of 1972 diamond performed for 20 consecutive nights at the winter garden theater in new york city 95 that theater had not staged a oneman show since al jolson in the 1930s 95 the approximately 1600seat broadway venue provided an intimate concert setting not common at the time with every performance reportedly sold out 95 it also made diamond the first rockera star to headline on broadway 95 the review in the new york times statedneil diamonds oneman show seemed on the face of it to be a brash idea oneman shows have traditionally been associated with talents like judy garland and danny kaye but mr diamond is clearly a brash young man and one with both the musical track record and the performance macho to bring it offhe neednt worry about comparisons with the likes of garland and kaye 95 after the winter garden shows diamond announced that he needed a break and he engaged in no live performances until 1976 he used those four years to work on the score for hall bartletts film version of richard bachs jonathan livingston seagull and to record two albums serenade and beautiful noise he said years later i knew id come back but i wasnt sure when i spent one year on each of those albumsid been on the road six years i had a son 2½ and i felt he needed me more than the audience did so for four years i devoted myself to my son jesse he also said he needed to get back to having a private life one where he could be anonymousin 1973 diamond switched labels again returning to columbia records for a milliondollaradvanceperalbum contract about 69 million per album in 2023 his first project released as a solo album was the soundtrack to jonathan livingston seagull the film received hostile reviews and did poorly at the box office and the album grossed more than the film did richard bach author of the bestselling source story disowned the film and he and diamond sued bartlett though for differing reasons in bachs case it was because he felt the film omitted too much from the original novella whereas in diamonds case it was because he felt the film had butchered his score after jonathan diamond declared i vowed never to get involved in a movie again unless i had complete control bartlett angrily responded to diamonds lawsuit by criticizing his music as having become too slickand its not as much from his heart as it used to be bartlett also added neil is extraordinarily talented often his arrogance is just a cover for the lonely and insecure person underneathdespite the controversy surrounding the film the soundtrack was a success peaking at no 2 on the billboard albums chart diamond also won a golden globe award for best original score and a grammy award for best score soundtrack album for a motion picture thereafter diamond often included a jonathan livingston seagull suite in his live performances as he did in his 1976 love at the greek concert and for his show in las vegas that same yeardiamond returned to live shows in 1976
