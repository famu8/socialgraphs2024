partially recorded in brighter shade studioscoy bowles transferred to atlantas georgia state university to study music he subsequently became involved in atlantas various music scenes and eventually formed coy bowles and the fellowship in 2004 two years later bowles decided to reconnect with brown through mutual friends he learned that the zac brown band was scheduled to perform in atlanta one evening bowles and brown spent the afternoon prior to the performance reacquainting with each other which ended with brown inviting bowles to sit in with his band at that nights performance to return the favor bowles invited the band to attend his own gig with the fellowship a couple of months later which in turn resulted in brown and his band sitting in at that gigthis turn of events continued for eight months until bowles concluded that it was too overwhelming to balance his time with browns band and his own band in addition to other activities he therefore made a decision to put the fellowship on an indefinite hiatus and became a permanent member of the zac brown bandin 2008 the zac brown band signed to live nation artists records in association with browns own home grown label after chris fryar became an addition to the band an alabama native fryar attended the university of north texas and the mississippi university for women and made a name for himself in the birmingham

release it himself brown also cowrote simple life a song recorded by the lost trailers on their 2006 selftitled albumin the third episode of hbos music documentary series sonic highways brown was a featured interviewee and explained why lost trailers version of chicken fried was pulled from the radio brown stated that after six years of touring that he was broke and sleeping in his tour van in 2005 the lost trailers contacted brown and expressed interest in recording chicken fried brown stated he agreed under the condition that the song would only be an album cut and not a single as he still had hopes of releasing the song as a radio single himselfboth parties agreed and the lost trailers recorded the song some months later the lost trailers landed a deal with sony nashville and when they submitted the tracks for their album they included chicken fried joe galante then the chairman of sony music nashville heard the tracks and chose chicken fried as the single that the label wanted to promotebrown described hearing his song on the radio the first time i hear chicken fried on the radio and it wasnt us singing it it was a nightmare brown then called his lawyer to have the song pulled from the radio immediately browns lawyer warned him that because of galantes power in the nashville music scene that pulling the song could essentially have him blackballed in nashville brown was insistent that his agreement with the lost trailers was violated so his lawyer issued a cease and desist letter and the single was pulled from the radioa few months later the zac brown band was booked to perform at 3rd and lindsley in nashville and producer keith stegall came to watch their performance stegall and brown had drinks later that night and brown recalled stegall stating i
