car into an oak tree while drunk and stoned on quaaludes with the birth of his daughter melody in 1976 van zant was making a serious attempt to clean up his act and curtail the cycle of boozedup brawling that was part of skynyrds reputationthe street survivors album of 1977 turned out to be a showcase for guitaristvocalist steve gaines who had joined the band just a year earlier and was making his studio debut with them publicly and privately ronnie van zant marveled at the multiple talents of skynyrds newest member claiming that the band would all be in his shadow one day gaines contributions included his colead vocal with van zant on the cowritten you got that right and the rousing guitar boogie i know a little which he had written before he joined skynyrd so confident was
