novellas protagonist on christmas eve scrooge is visited by marleys ghost who wanders the earth entwined by heavy chains and money boxes forged during a lifetime of greed and selfishness marley tells scrooge that he has a single chance of redemption to avoid the same fate he will be visited by three spirits in the hope that he will mend his ways otherwise he will be cursed to carry much heavier chains of his ownby early 1843 dickens had been affected by the treatment of the poor and in particular the treatment of the children of the poor after witnessing children working in appalling conditions in a tin mine and following a visit to a ragged school originally intending to write a political pamphlet titled an appeal to the people of england on behalf of the poor mans child he changed his mind and instead wrote a christmas carol which voiced his social concerns about poverty and injustice the ghost of jacob marley in stave one becomes a mouthpiece for part of dickenss message regarding thesein the novella marley and scrooge were partners for i dont know how many years and were indistinguishable both being good men of business grasping of money and unconcerned about the wellbeing of their fellow travellers to the grave while it appears that marley had died without being punished in life for his lack of social responsibility and his indifference to the wellbeing of his fellow man unbeknown to scrooge after death marley is forced to roam the earth in purgatory fettered in chains cash boxes and ledger books desperately wanting to help the poor and needy but unable to do so on the seventh anniversary of his death on christmas eve the ghost of jacob marley in his torment appears to scrooge in his roomsmarley in his pigtail usual waistcoat tights and boots the tassels on the latter bristling like his pigtail and his coatskirts and the hair upon his head the chain he drew was clasped about his middle it was long and wound about him like a tail and it was made for scrooge observed it closely of cashboxes keys padlocks ledgers deeds and heavy purses wrought in steel his body was transparent so that scrooge observing him and looking through his waistcoat could see the two buttons on his coat behindmarley warns scrooge that his own chain was as full and heavy as marleys seven years ago and that he has been working on it since owing to his indifference to the poor scrooges chain is now ponderous and to avoid an eternity of purgatory scrooge must change his life and show penance to assist him with this marley has interceded for scrooge to be visited by three spirits who will offer him the chance of escaping the same fate marley warns scrooge to expect the first spirit when the clock tolls one the second upon the next night at the same hour and the third upon the third night when the clock has reached the last stroke of twelve regardless of scrooges suggestion for them to come all at once marley tells scrooge that he will not see him again and leaves the room through the open window where he joins other souls in limbo outside who are tormented by their inability to help the poor and needy in death as they should have done in lifeother than the fact that scrooge and marley had been business partners in their counting house for many years and that the two men were alike in their greed dickens provides little background information about jacob marley his presence in the story is to provide a warning in stave one concerning the miserliness and misanthropy of scrooge and to act as a herald for the three ghosts of christmas who are to come marleys intercession with some higher power so that scrooge will not share marleys fate is provided as the explanation for the supernatural visitors who are to followthe book makes it clear from the start that old marley was as dead as a doornail a phrase first recorded in langlands piers plowman of 1362 where it appears as ded as a dorenayl the readers understanding of this fact makes marleys later appearance before scrooge all the more shocking dickens writes scrooge knew he was dead of course he did how could it be otherwise scrooge and he were partners for i dont know how many years scrooge was his sole executor his sole administrator his sole assign his sole residuary legatee his sole friend and sole mourner the two men were business partners and probably little else despite scrooges fearful comment that you were always a good friend to me jacob it is unlikely that the two were actually close as even on the day of marleys funeral scrooge takes time out to make a good business dealit becomes clear that marleys punishment is not to be condemned to hell a place of eternal torment from which there is no release and no escape but that he is in purgatory as he has been constantly wandering the earth in the seven years since his death this is evidenced by his remorse and his desire to do good for the poor and needy those he had ignored in life but he is in torment himself as he is now unable to help marley states to scroogeit is required of every man the ghost returned that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen and travel far and wide and if that spirit goes not forth in life it is condemned to do so after death it is doomed to wander through the world—oh woe is me—and witness what it can not share but might have shared on earth and turned to happinessmarley tells scrooge that his appearance before him is no light part of penance and that it offers scrooge a hope and chance of redemption a chance and hope says marley of my procuring as scrooges own redemption forms part of marleys penance he too must also have the hope of eventual redemption and he could not hope for this if he was in hell dickenss statement that marley had no bowels is a reference to the bowels of compassion mentioned in the first epistle of john the reason for his tormentthe chain with which marley is fettered represents his sins in life and his guilt in failing to help his fellow man he forged the chain himself and wears it through his lack of compassion for others indeed the ghosts that scrooge sees outside his window are similarly fettered with objects associated with the sins committed in their livesevery one of them wore chains like marleys ghost some few they might be guilty governments were linked together none were free many had been personally known to scrooge in their lives he had been quite familiar with one old ghost in a white waistcoat with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant whom it saw below upon a doorstep the misery with them all was clearly that they sought to interfere for good in human matters and had lost the power for everclearly these tormented souls outside the window like marley and scrooge are guilty of having failed to help those in need while they were alive now they are dead it is too late and the chains with which they too are fettered were also forged by them in life and girded on of their own free will they are imprisoned by their chains in the same way prisoners would have been fettered in victorian gaols none of the spectres wear their chains willingly while normally chains would be forged from metal marleys chains are forged from what he valued in life — money and material wealth attached to marleys chain are ledgers and cash boxes with each object symbolising moneymaking – his priority in life – and how he failed to act to help others each of the other spectres similarly has attached to them the heavy symbols of their former trades the old ghost that scrooge recognises has a monstrous iron safe attached to his chain perhaps showing that like scrooge he was a miser who hoarded his money instead of helping those in need he is a kindred spirit to scrooge which is perhaps why scrooge recognizes him it is apparent that these ghosts like marley are suffering because it is now too late for them to help the living and they now have no chance of redemption – to put things right the chain with which scrooge is unknowingly girded would be stronger and heavier and more ponderous than that about marley as scrooge has been working on it for seven years more through each act of indifference to those about himone theory for marleys origin put forward by the filmwriter and author roger clarke and the historian daisy dunn is that dickens was influenced by the writings of pliny the younger who related a celebrated account of a haunted house from the ancient classical world c 50 ad in 1825 the young dickens was sent to wellington house classical and commercial academy where in 1827 he won the latin prize it may have been as part of his studies that he first encountered plinys ghostly tale however dunn states that in his library dickens had a copy of the philosophy of mystery by walter cooper dendy published in 1841 two years before dickens wrote a christmas carol the book also relates plinys description of the haunting of the house in athens which was bought by the stoic philosopher athenodorus who lived about 100 years before pliny knowing that the house was supposedly haunted athenodorus intentionally set up his writing desk in the room where the apparition was said to appear and sat there writing until late at night when he was disturbed by a ghost which came at first to the door and then into the chamber and who like marley was bound in chains pliny wrote to his friend sura that in the dead of the night a noise resembling the clashing of iron was frequently heard which if you listened more attentively sounded like the rattling of fetters at first it seemed at a distance but approached nearer by degrees immediately afterward a phantom appeared in the form of an old man extremely meagre and squalid with a long beard and bristling hair rattling the gyves on his feet and hands athenodorus followed the ghost outside where it indicated a spot on the ground when athenodorus later excavated the area a shackled skeleton was unearthed the haunting ceased when the skeleton was given a proper reburialfor the chained marley dickens possibly also drew on his memory of a visit to the western penitentiary in pittsburgh pennsylvania in march 1842 where he saw—and was affected by seeing—fettered prisoners and wondered whether they were nightly visited by spectreswhen dickens was young he lived in lodgings at 10 norfolk street present day 22 cleveland street in londons fitzrovia district just yards away from a local cheesemonger called marley and near also to a tradesmans premises with the sign goodge and marney either of which may have provided the name for scrooge and his former business partner though dr
