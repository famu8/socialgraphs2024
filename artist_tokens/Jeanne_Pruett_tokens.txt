she rewrote the introduction to help make the song recordfriendly after rewriting the beginning she presented it to haynes walter played it for grady and he flipped out he picked up the guitar and played it back to walter note for note and said here walt the damn intro is a hit she recalled in her autobiography decca now mca records believed that satin sheets was too traditional in its production and chose not to promote it as a single instead pruett promoted it herself she distributed the record by cutting squares of pink satin and mailing it to disc jockeys the marketing method worked when satin sheets reached number one on the billboard hot country singles chart in may 1973 the song also rose to number 28 on the billboard hot 100 the songs success prompted an album of the same name to be released in june 1973 the album topped the billboard top country albums chart in july becoming her highestcharting lpsatin sheets gained positive responses and acclaim following its success while reviewing her 1973 album billboard magazine stated that miss pruett lets loose some of that talent that restrained in relative obscurity over the years in later years writer kurt wolff

major comeback after three of her singles reached the top ten of the billboard country songs chart the first was the selfpenned back to back which reached number six the following single release temporarily yours became her highest peaking ibc hit when it reached number five its too late would reach number nine on the country chart before the end of 1980 billboard took notice of pruetts
