proud mary and the album bayou countryfogerty as writer of the songs for the band as well as lead singer and lead guitarist felt that his musical opinions should count for more than those of the others leading to resentments within the band these internal rifts and toms feeling that he was being taken for granted caused tom to leave the group in january 1971 the two other group members bassist cook and drummer clifford wanted a greater role in the bands future fogerty in an attempt to keep things together insisted cook and clifford share equal songwriting and vocal time on what became the bands final album mardi gras released in april 1972 which included the bands last two singles the 1971 hit sweet hitchhiker and someday never comes which made it into the billboard top 20cook and clifford told fogerty that the fans would not accept mardi gras as a ccr lp but fogerty told them my voice is a unique instrument and i will not lend it to your songs according to the two bandmates fogerty gave them an ultimatum either they would do it or fogerty would quit immediately they accepted fogertys ultimatum the album received poor reviews but was a commercial success peaking at number 12 and achieving goldrecord status though it generated weaker sales than previous albums the group disbanded shortly after the album was releasedthe only reunion of all four original members

set at their 25th class reunioneven early in his career “ fogertys attitude toward music serious practiced even perfectionistic he drilled his bandmates in rehearsal after rehearsal insisting that his songs be performed his way was known for not indulging in drugs and although john struggled with alcohol later in life he had only contempt for musicians whose habits interfered with their performances ” “ not in my band ” he writes in his memoir fortunate son “ you dare not be stoned playing music around me when youre working youre supposed to be working ” as ccr was coming to an end fogerty began working on a solo album of country and western covers on which he produced arranged and played all of the instruments despite the solo nature of the recordings however fogerty elected to credit the album to the blue ridge rangers—a band of which he was the only memberthe eponymous the blue ridge rangers was released in 1973 it spun off the top20 hit jambalaya as well as a lesser hit in hearts of stone fogerty still using the blue ridge rangers name then released a selfpenned rockandroll single you dont owe me bw back in the hills fantasy f710 it was a commercial flop failing to make the us billboard hot 100 though you dont owe me was a minor hit in canada reaching no 79 fogerty thereafter abandoned the blue ridge rangers identity and released all his subsequent work under his own name in early 1974 fogerty released comin down the road—backed with the instrumental ricochethis first official solo album john fogerty was released in 1975 sales were slim and legal problems delayed a followup though it yielded rockin all over the world a no 27 hit for fogerty in the united states in 1977 the british rock band status quo recorded their version of rockin all over the world which became a huge hit and made the song worldfamous status quo played it at the opening of the 1985 live aid concertin 1976 fogerty finished an album called hoodoo a single you got the magic backed with evil thing preceded the albums release but it performed poorly the album for which covers had already been printed was rejected by asylum records a few weeks before its scheduled release and fogerty agreed that it was not up to his usual high standards fogerty told asylum records to destroy the master tapes for hoodoo sometime in the 1980safter a hiatus of several years from the music industry fogertys solo career reemerged with 1985s centerfield his first album for warner bros records which had taken coownership of asylums contract with fogerty centerfield went to the top of the charts and included a top10 hit in the old man down the road the title track is frequently played on classic rock radio and at baseball games to this day but the album led to legal problems for fogertytwo songs on the album zanz kant danz and mr greed were believed to be attacks on fogertys former boss at fantasy records saul zaentz zanz kant danz was about a pig that can not dance but would steal your money when zaentz responded with a lawsuit fogerty issued a revised version vanz kant danz changing the lead characters name to vanz another lawsuit fantasy inc v fogerty claimed that the old man down the road shared the same chorus as run through the jungle a song from fogertys days with ccr to which fantasy records still owned the publishing rights fogerty ultimately won his case when he proved that the two songs were distinct compositions and also that sounding like himself was not plagiarizing fogerty then countersued for attorney fees fogerty v fantasy after losing in the ninth circuit court of appeals fogerty won his case in the us supreme court which ruled that a trial court has discretion in awarding fees to defendants or plaintiffson may 31 1985 fogerty filmed a onehour music and interview special for showtime called john fogertys allstars the setlist consisted of rhythm and blues tunes from the 1960s as well as material from the centerfield lp and the song

prairie princethe followup album to centerfield was eye of the zombie in 1986 but it was significantly less successful than its predecessor fogerty toured behind the album but he refused to play any ccr material eye of the zombie took on a darker mood talking about a troubled society terrorism and pop stars selling out for over 20 years after the eye of the zombie tour ended in late 1986 fogerty refused to play material from the album in concert however change in the weather was included in the setlist for his 2009 tour and it was even rerecorded for that years solo release the blue ridge

steve jordan on drumsin 1990 his brother tom fogerty died of complications from aids at the age of 48 survived by his second wife and six children tom contracted hiv from blood transfusions during surgery for a back ailment specifically he died from a tuberculosis infection john fogerty has mentioned that the darkest moments in his life were when his brother took the record companys side in their royalties dispute and the fact that when his brother died the two of them were barely speaking to each other in fact even in the brothers very last conversation with each other tom at one point referred to creedence clearwater revivals former manager saul zaentz as his best friend given that zaentz had swindled the band out of millions of dollars and had just recently attempted to sue john this revelation made it painfully difficult for john to reconcile with tom in the eulogy he delivered at toms funeral he said we wanted to grow up and be musicians i guess we achieved half of that becoming rock n roll stars we didnt necessarily grow upfogerty traveled to mississippi in 1990 for inspiration and visited the gravesite of blues legend robert johnson according to him while there he had the realization that robert johnson was the true spiritual owner of his own songs no matter what businessman owned the rights to them thus fogerty decided to start making a new album and to perform his old ccr material regularly in concert at this time visiting the mt zion missionary baptist church cemetery fogerty met skip henderson a new jersey vintage guitar dealer who had formed a nonprofit corporation the mt zion memorial fund to honor johnson with a memorial marker fogerty subsequently funded headstones for charlie patton james “ son ” thomas mississippi joe callicott eugene

with his former bandmates and fellow inductees stu cook and doug clifford during the musical portion of the induction ceremony citing the zaentz lawsuit as a reason in place of the surviving members of ccr fogerty recruited session musicians on drums and bass and was also joined by bruce springsteen and robbie robertson in performing three songs wholl stop the rain born on the bayou and green river the other two surviving members were believed to have laughed it off in disappointment during the induction speech springsteen said as a songwriter only a few did as much in three minutes he was an old testament shaggyhaired prophet a fatalist funny too he was severe he was precise he said what he had to say and he got out of therefogerty returned to the commercial music industry in 1997 with
