their good fortune both having options that for many women are financially prohibitive mentioning the stigma attached to ivf maguire said i think we feel a responsibility to break down some barriers its much more of a common problem than people realize a final concern maguire mentioned was the question of what to do with all the unused frozen embryosnow that i have children i see those embryos as possible children so i have to think about what my options are if there are leftovers again i could keep them in storage and maybe they will help my children some day or i can try to donate them to stem cell research i dont think i could give them to another family i would always worry what if its an abusive family what if they dont get enough lovenatalie maines has noted that she and maguire
