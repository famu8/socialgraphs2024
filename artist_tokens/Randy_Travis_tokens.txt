song as a tiein to his thousand points of light campaign for volunteerism because of its inspiration travis noted that journalists often asked him about political matters and he refused to answer them

blues while travis also cowrote im gon na have a little talk featuring backing vocals from gospel group take 6 and oh what a time to be me with schlitz travis said that he intentionally wrote more songs for the album than previous ones as he had fewer tour dates and thus had more time to focus on songwriting jurek praised the jackson cowrites in particular highlighting their lyrics and vocal deliveries in his review for allmusic nash also praised the lyrics on the songs cowritten by jackson while also stating that travis never sounded so relaxed or so confidentlater the same year warner

both greatesthits albums certified platinum in 1995travis took a hiatus from touring in 1992 and 1993 citing exhaustion as the reason for doing so he and hatcher chose to spend time at a property in

merely taking a break during the hiatus he released an album of western music titled wind in the wire a tiein to a television movie of the same name in which he starred the album was produced by session guitarist steve gibson making it his first since the randy ray album not to be produced by kyle lehning it was commercially unsuccessful with none of its singles reaching top 40 on the billboard charts however lead single cowboy boogie reached number 10 on the canadian country music charts then published by rpm travis and one of his managers later attributed the albums commercial failure to its western swing sound proving unpopular with radioin late 1993 travis began working on a followup album with lehning when he was contacted by a representative for the thenunder construction mgm grand las vegas in las vegas nevada the representative wanted travis to be the first country artist to perform at the new venue once it opened which inspired travis to begin touring again he and hatcher joined with jeff davis another former manager of traviss who was then working with brother phelps to assemble a backing band for the las vegas shows which included lehning as keyboardist the las vegas shows held in early 1994 were his first concerts in over 14 months due to the success of these shows travis resumed his touring schedule soon afterward he reestablished his existing touring band and performed at a showcase of warner bros artists held in nashville during the country radio seminar an annual promotional concert series held by country radio broadcasters at the same time travis continued writing and compiling songs for his next studio album before you kill us all was released on february 28 1994 as the lead single to his next warner album this is me the song peaked at number two on the billboard country charts travis and lehning chose the song because the two wanted story songs and some with a wink of humor similarly he told billboard in 1994 that the song was an example of a more modern and rowdy sound he wanted to achieve relative to his prior albums it was followed later in the year by whisper my name his fifteenth numberone on billboard the albums title track and the box were both topten hits between late 1994 and early 1995 as well travis wrote the box with buck moore and later said he became emotional writing and performing the song as its theme of a father struggling to express love to his children reminded him of his own fractured relationship with his fatherbob saporiti then an executive at warner bros nashville noted that the failure of wind in the wire and length of time since high lonesome had created angst among label executives but added that they considered this is me back to the basics to promote the album travis hosted an episode of the tnn talk show music city tonight the network also reaired the country radio seminar concert jurek praised the lyrical contributions of trey bruce larry gatlin and kieran kane and considered whisper my name to be among the greatest songs travis has ever recorded nash thought that the lyrics of the singles were among traviss strongest also stating that the album had zippier instrumental touches than his 1980s albums additionally larkin stated that the album was as strong as ever by mid1994 this is me was certified gold by the riaa despite spending most of 1995 without a charted single travis continued to tour throughout the year alongside sammy kershaw and george jonestraviss final album for warner was full circle in 1996 travis told billboard prior to its release that he and lehning spent over a year selecting songs for the album because they wanted to be sure they were fully satisfied with its content its lead single was are we in trouble now a song written by mark knopfler both this song and followup would i failed to reach the top 20 on the country charts while neither price to pay nor a cover of roger millers king of the road which also appeared on the soundtrack of the 1997 movie traveller made top 40 richmond timesdispatch writer gordon ely noted the failure of the albums lead single and questioned whether the album and travis in general could still be successful in the long term due to an influx of younger artists in the intervening years ely considered the album strong as ever with a focus on lehnings production and traviss voice as well as the lyrics of price to pay country standard time writer don yates found the influence of honkytonk in certain songs and praised the lyrics and vocal delivery of are we in trouble now but criticized would i as gimmicky and closing track ants on a log as trite allmusic writer thom owens said of full circle his mid90s albums suffered from a tendency to sound a bit too similar too each other full circle solves that problem by simultaneously reaching back into his hardcore honkytonk roots and moving toward more contemporary materialin mid1997 travis announced that he had departed from warner bros due to disagreements over the promotion of full circle as well as concerns that the country music industry was beginning to move toward back country pop influences travis also observed at the time that warner executives were not letting him lehning and hatcher have as much liberty on selecting singles as they had on previous albums at the time of his departure from warner travis was offered contracts by both asylum records and the thennew dreamworks records lehning had just become president of asylums nashville division at the time but travis chose not to follow him to that label as he did not think lehnings position was longtermby august 1997 travis had become the first artist signed to the nashville branch of dreamworks records the new labels president was musician and producer james stroud whom travis knew because he had played drums on some of his earlier singles such as forever and ever amen because lehnings duties as president of asylum left him temporarily unavailable as a producer stroud and byron gallimore best known for his work with tim mcgraw would produce traviss music for dreamworks traviss late1997 single out of my bones was the first release for dreamworks nashville cowritten by gary burr and sharon vaughn it peaked at number two on the country charts in early 1998 it appeared on his first dreamworks album you and you alone issued in april the project also accounted for the topten hits the hole and spirit of a boy wisdom of a man and the top20 stranger in my mirror both the hole and stranger in my mirror were cowritten by skip ewing spirit of a boy wisdom of a man was previously recorded by mark collie on his 1995 album tennessee plates jeffrey b remz of country standard time criticized the heavy drums on i did my part but otherwise praised the use of acoustic instruments and the strength of traviss voice lincoln journal star writer l kent wolgamott noted the presence of fiddle and steel guitar in the production while also calling traviss voice expressivein 1999 travis was one of several artists on the collaborative song same old train featured on the tribute album tribute to tradition other acts appearing on the song included clint black dwight yoakam pam tillis and marty stuart the last of whom also wrote and produced it the track won a grammy award for best country collaboration with vocals for all artists involved traviss second and final dreamworks album a man aint made of stone also came out in 1999 the title track was a top20 country hit by years end but the other singles—where can i surrender a little left of center and ill be right here loving you—all failed to reach top 40 gallimore and stroud recorded the album largely in santa fe new mexico where travis and hatcher had a house at the time following the failure of the albums singles travis exited dreamworks records in october 2000 shortly after his departure travis told country standard time that he chose to leave dreamworks because he felt the label was not properly distributing the album to stores he also thought that strouds production style put too much emphasis on the instrumentation instead of his singing voicewhile he was still on warner travis had begun working with lehning on a gospel music album other than a cover of amazing grace the two intentionally sought to include original content travis finished the tracks at a time when he was not on a record label through a connection lehning had with word records executive barry landis travis was signed to that label in late 2000 and released the gospel album by then titled inspirational journey waylon jennings and jessi colter provided guest vocals on the track the carpenter kenny chesney sang duet vocals on the track baptism also titled down with the old

the year for the album itself and country recorded song of the year for baptism allmusic reviewer todd everett found influences of bluegrass don williams and lefty frizzell and found it consistent with traviss 1980s and 1990s albums in tone alanna nash of entertainment weekly was less favorable as she thought that the album had strong opening tracks but added that midway it deteriorates into nashville formula with simplistic homilies overblown productionfollowing the september 11 attacks in 2001 travis cowrote and released a promotional patriotic single titled america will always stand

life helped launch the new traditionalist movement in the virgin encyclopedia of country music colin larkin wrote that travis was the first modern performer to demonstrate that country music could appeal to a wider public and perhaps garth brooks owes him a debt alanna nash similarly stated that travis was a standard bearer for the genres shift toward neotraditional country through later acts

singers travis and hatcher booked daryle singletary as an opening act and member of their touring band after hearing his vocals on the demo of an old pair of shoes and he would often join travis in this capacity to sing its just a matter of time after singletary signed a recording contract with giant records in 1995 travis coproduced singletarys selftitled debut album nash referred to singletary
