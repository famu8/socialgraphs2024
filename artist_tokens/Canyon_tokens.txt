a canyon from spanish cañón archaic british english spelling cañon gorge or chasm is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from weathering and the erosive activity of a river over geologic time scales rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces eventually wearing away rock layers as sediments are removed downstream a river bed will gradually reach a baseline elevation which is the same elevation as the body of water into which the river drains the processes of weathering and erosion will form canyons when the rivers headwaters and estuary are at significantly different elevations particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weatheringa canyon may also refer to a rift between two mountain peaks such as those in ranges including the rocky mountains the alps the himalayas or the andes usually a river or stream carves out such splits between mountains examples of mountaintype canyons are provo canyon in utah or yosemite valley in californias sierra nevada canyons within mountains or gorges that have an opening on only one side are called box canyons slot canyons are very narrow canyons that often have smooth wallssteepsided valleys in the seabed of the continental slope are referred to as submarine canyons unlike canyons on land submarine canyons are thought to be formed by turbidity currents and landslidesthe word canyon is spanish in origin cañón pronounced with the same meaning the word canyon is generally used in north america while the words gorge and ravine french in origin are used in europe and oceania though gorge and ravine are also used in some parts of north america in the united states place names generally use canyon in the southwest due to their proximity to spanishspeaking mexico and gorge in the northeast which is closer to french canada with the rest of the country graduating between these two according to geography in canada a gorge is usually narrow while a ravine is more open and often wooded the militaryderived word defile is occasionally used in the united kingdom in south africa kloof in krantzkloof nature reserve is used along with canyon as in blyde river canyon and gorge in oribi gorgemost canyons were formed by a process of longtime erosion from a plateau or tableland level the cliffs form because harder rock strata that are resistant to erosion and weathering remain exposed on the valley wallscanyons are much more common in arid areas than in wet areas because physical weathering has a more localized effect in arid zones the wind and water from the river combine to erode and cut away less resistant materials such as shales the freezing and expansion of water also serves to help form canyons water seeps into cracks between the rocks and freezes pushing the rocks apart and eventually causing large chunks to break off the canyon walls in a process known as frost wedging canyon walls are often formed of resistant sandstones or granitesometimes large rivers run through canyons as the result of gradual geological uplift these are called entrenched rivers because they are unable to easily alter their course in the united states the colorado river in the southwest and the snake river in the northwest are two examples of tectonic upliftcanyons often form in areas of limestone rock as limestone is soluble to a certain extent cave systems form in the rock when a cave system collapses a canyon is left as in the mendip hills in somerset and yorkshire dales in yorkshire englanda box canyon is a small canyon that is generally shorter and narrower than a river canyon with steep walls on three sides allowing access and egress only through the mouth of the canyon box canyons were frequently used in the western united states as convenient corrals with their entrances fencedthe definition of largest canyon is imprecise because a canyon can be large by its depth its length or the total area of the canyon system also the inaccessibility of the major canyons in the himalaya contributes to their not being regarded as candidates for the biggest canyon the definition of deepest canyon is similarly imprecise especially if one includes mountain canyons as well as canyons cut through relatively flat plateaus which have a somewhat welldefined rim elevationthe yarlung tsangpo grand canyon or tsangpo canyon along the yarlung tsangpo river in tibet is regarded by some as the deepest canyon in the world at 5500 metres 18000 ft it is slightly longer than the grand canyon in the united states others consider the kali gandaki gorge in midwest nepal to be the deepest canyon with a 6400metre 21000 ft difference between the level of the river and the peaks surrounding itvying for the deepest canyon in the americas is the cotahuasi canyon and colca canyon in southern peru both have been measured at over 3500 metres 11500 ft deepthe grand canyon of northern arizona in the united states with an average depth of 1600 metres 5200 ft and a volume of 417 trillion cubic metres 147 trillion cubic feet is one of the worlds largest canyons it was among the 28 finalists of the new 7 wonders of nature worldwide poll some referred to it as one of the seven natural wonders of the worldthe largest canyon in europe is tara river canyonthe largest canyon in africa is the fish river canyon in namibiain august 2013 the discovery of greenlands grand canyon was reported based on the analysis of data from operation icebridge it is located under an ice sheet at 750 kilometres 470 mi long it is believed to be the longest canyon in the worlddespite not being quite as deep or long as the grand canyon the capertee valley in australia is actually 1 km wider than the grand canyon making it the widest canyon in the worldsome canyons have notable cultural significance evidence of archaic humans has been discovered in africas olduvai gorge in the southwestern united states canyons are important archeologically because of the many cliffdwellings built in such areas largely by the ancient pueblo people who were their first inhabitantsthe following list contains only the most notable canyons of the world grouped by regionvenus has many craters and canyons on its surface the troughs on the planet are part of a system of canyons that is more than 6400 km long
