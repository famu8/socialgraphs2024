quit ridingowens was devastated by richs death and did not discuss it in interviews for years in a late1990s interview owens said he was like a brother a son and a best friend something i never said before maybe i couldnt but i think my music life ended when he died oh yeah i carried on and i existed but the real joy and love the real lightning and thunder is gone foreveryears after dons death marlane remarried to larry dunivent and had two children she continues to stay involved in dons legacy and endeavors to keep the love for his music alivedon rich used primarily fender guitars and amplifiers in the early days rich played owens 1951 fender telecaster through a fender bassman amplifier in 1964 fender gave owens an endorsement deal and the band gained instruments rich received a telecaster that had both its body and headstock finished in champagne metal flake in addition to having checkerboard binding on both sides of the guitars body the champagne metal flake finish was somewhat rough because it contained crushed glass the band received other fender amplifiers as well so rich also played through a twin reverb amplifier at some point don had a oneoff telecasterish red mosrite that is now in possession of the owens estate bucks 1951 telecaster showed significant signs of being artist maintained rather than by a luthier for example there were pieces of paper under strings at the nut in slots that were slotted too deep owens and rich received new guitars in 1966 a pair of silver flake telecasters that were double bound in plain black also around 1966 owens had bakersfield guitar repairmantechnic gene moles finish another set of guitars in red white and blue fender also gave rich a gold sparkle telecaster in the late 1960s that was bound in plain black it had no finish on the headstockfenders deal with most of their artists was that they would exchange their instruments for new ones every seven years or so owens refused to return the instruments given to them by fender so fender stopped giving them instruments gibson picked up on this and in the early 1970s they struck up a deal with owens rich received an es335 and a les paul professional model owens and rich later went back to playing their red white and blue telecasters
