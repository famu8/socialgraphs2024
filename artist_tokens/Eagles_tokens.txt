see texteagle is the common name for the golden eagle bald eagle and other birds of prey in the family of the accipitridae eagles belong to several groups of genera some of which are closely related true eagles comprise the genus aquila most of the 68 species of eagles are from eurasia and africa outside this area just 14 species can be found—two in north america nine in central and south america and three in australiaeagles are not a natural group but denote essentially any kind of bird of prey large enough to hunt sizeable about 50 cm long or more overall vertebratesthe word eagle is borrowed into english from anglonorman eagle and middle french aigle both derived ultimately from latin aquila eagle it is cognate with terms such as french aigle portuguese águia and spanish águila it is broadly synonymous with the less common english term erne or earn deriving from middle english ern from old english earn in which it acts as the usual word for the bird the old english term is turn derived from protogermanic arnuz and is cognate with other synonymous words in germanic languages such as swedish örn german aar and gothic ara through the protoindoeuropean root it is further related to words such as greek ὄρνις bird and lithuanian erelis eagle although erne can be used to refer to any eagle it is most commonly used for the golden eagle or seaeagleeagles are large powerfullybuilt birds of prey with heavy heads and beaks even the smallest eagles such as the booted eagle hieraaetus pennatus which is comparable in size to a common buzzard buteo buteo or redtailed hawk b jamaicensis have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings and more direct faster flight despite the reduced size of their aerodynamic feathers most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart from some vultures the smallest species of eagle is the great nicobar serpent eagle spilornis klossi at 450 g 1 lb and 40 cm 16 in the largest species are discussed below like all birds of prey eagles have very large hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their prey strong muscular legs and powerful talonsthe beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey eagles eyes are extremely powerful it is estimated that the wedgetailed eagle has a visual acuity twice that of a typical human this acuity enables eagles to spot potential prey from a very long distance this keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction scattering of the incoming light like most diurnal raptors eagles have little ability to see ultraviolet light the female of all known species of eagles is larger than the maleeagles normally build their nests called eyries in tall trees or on high cliffs many species lay two eggs but the older larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched the parents take no action to stop the killingit is said that eagles fly above clouds but this is not true eagles fly during storms and glide from the winds pressure this saves the birds energy due to the size and power of many eagle species they are ranked at the top of the food chain as apex predators in the avian world the type of prey varies by genus the haliaeetus and icthyophaga eagles prefer to capture fish though the species in the former often capture various animals especially other water birds and are powerful kleptoparasites of other birds the snake and serpent eagles of the genera circaetus terathopius and spilornis predominantly prey on the great diversity of snakes found in the tropics of africa and asia the eagles of the genus aquila are often the top birds of prey in open habitats taking almost any mediumsized vertebrate they can catch where aquila eagles are absent other eagles such as the buteonine blackchested buzzardeagle of south america may assume the position of top raptorial predator in open areas many other eagles including the speciesrich genus spizaetus live predominantly in woodlands and forests these eagles often target various arboreal or grounddwelling mammals and birds which are often unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense knotty environments hunting techniques differ among the species and genera with some individual eagles having engaged in quite varied techniques based on their environment and prey at any given time most eagles grab prey without landing and take flight with it so the prey can be carried to a perch and torn apartthe bald eagle is noted for having flown with the heaviest load verified to be carried by any flying bird since one eagle flew with a 68 kg 15 lb mule deer fawn however a few eagles may target prey considerably heavier than themselves such prey is too heavy to fly with thus it is either eaten at the site of the kill or taken in pieces back to a perch or nest golden and crowned eagles have killed ungulates weighing up to 30 kg 66 lb and a martial eagle even killed a 37 kg 82 lb duiker 7–8 times heavier than the preying eagle authors on birds david allen sibley pete dunne and clay sutton described the behavioral difference between hunting eagles and other birds of prey thus in this case the bald and golden eagles as compared to other north american raptorsthey have at least one singular characteristic it has been observed that most birds of prey look back over their shoulders before striking prey or shortly thereafter predation is after all a twoedged sword all hawks seem to have this habit from the smallest kestrel to the largest ferruginous – but not the eaglesamong the eagles are some of the largest birds of prey only the condors and some of the old world vultures are markedly larger it is regularly debated which should be considered the largest species of eagle they could be measured variously in total length body mass or wingspan different lifestyle needs among various eagles result in variable measurements from species to species for example many forestdwelling eagles including the very large harpy eagle have relatively short wingspans a feature necessary for being able to maneuver in quick short bursts through densely forested habitats eagles in the genus aquila found almost exclusively in open country are noted for their ability to soar and have relatively long wings for their sizethese lists of the top five eagles are based on weight length and wingspan respectively unless otherwise noted by reference the figures listed are the median reported for each measurement in the guide raptors of the world in which only measurements that could be personally verified by the authors were listedthe eagles are generally distributed in all types of habitats and nearly all parts of the world the birds can be found in northern tundra to tropical rainforests and deserts in north america bald eagles and golden eagles are very commoneagles are often informally divided into four groupsthe snake eagles are placed in the subfamily circaetinae the fish eagles booted eagles and harpy eagles have traditionally been placed in the subfamily buteoninae together with the buzzardhawks buteonine hawks and harriers some authors may treat these groups as tribes of the buteoninae lerner mindell proposed separating the eagle groups into their own subfamilies of accipitridaesea eagles or fish eagles take fish as a large part of their diets either fresh or as carrionproposed subfamily haliaeetinae genera haliaeetus icthyophagasome authors include gypohierax angolensis the vulturine fish eagle also called the palmnut vulture in this group however genetic analyses indicate it is related to a grouping of neophron–gypaetus–eutriorchis egyptian vulture bearded vulture lammergeier and madagascar serpent eaglethe fish eagles have a close genetic relationship with haliastur and milvus the whole group is only distantly related to the buteo groupfish eagles exist in every continent throughout the world except for south americaalthough fish eagles can be found in many different places around the world they have been classified as near threatened reasons such as overfishing pollution habitat destruction and the use of pesticides have contributed to the species rapid population dropthe booted eagle is a group of eagle that typically migrates across the sahara desert to europe it usually reaches europe around the beginning of march and leaves by the end of september its interesting to note that these types of eagles usually mate with the same partner and return to the same areas years later female booted eagles usually lay 14 eggs which promptly hatch after 37 to 40 days researchers estimate that there are between 3600 to 6900 pairs of booted eagles in europe which are mostly situated in the iberian peninsulabooted eagles or true eagles have feathered tarsi lower legstribe aquililae or proposed subfamily aquilinae genera aquila hieraaetus spizaetus oroaetus spizastur nisaetus ictinaetus lophoaetus polemaetus and stephanoaetussee comments under eagle species for changes to the composition of these generamost snake or serpent eagles as the name suggests primarily prey on snakesdespite filling the niche of a snake eagle genetic studies suggest that the madagascar serpent eagle eutriorchis is not related to themover several decades a great deal of research has been done on the snakeeagles diet which is mainly made up of reptiles especially snakes when it comes to catching snakes it is generally accepted that the bird exhibits generalist feeding behavior which means it does not hunt down specific types of snakes but rather feeds on them depending on their availability in the wildharpy eagles or giant forest eagles are large eagles that inhabit tropical forests the group contains two to six species depending on the author although these birds occupy similar niches and have traditionally been grouped they are not all related the solitary eagles are related to the black hawks and the philippine eagle to the snake eaglesmajor new research into eagle taxonomy suggests that the important genera aquila and hieraaetus are not composed of nearest relatives and it is likely that a reclassification of these genera will soon take place with some species being moved to lophaetus or ictinaetusfamily accipitridaethe modern english term for the bird is derived from latin aquila by way of french aigle the origin of aquila is unknown but it is believed to possibly derive from aquilus meaning darkcolored swarthy or blackish as a reference to the plumage of eaglesold english used the term earn related to scandinavias ørnörn it is similar to other indoeuropean terms for bird or eagle including greek ὄρνις ornís russian орёл orël and welsh eryrin the southern part of finland near the gulf of finland is the town of kotka which literally means eagle while the town of laquila in the central part of italy literally means the eaglein britain before 1678 eagle referred specifically to the golden eagle with the other native species the whitetailed eagle being known as erne the modern name golden eagle for aquila chrysaetos was introduced by the naturalist john raythe village of eagle in lincolnshire england has nothing to do with the bird its name is derived from the old english words for oak and wood compare oakleyin the ancient sumerian mythology the mythical king etana was said to have been carried into heaven by an eagle classical writers such as lucan and pliny the elder claimed that the eagle was able to look directly at the sun and that they forced their fledglings to do the same those that blinked would be cast from the nest this belief persisted until the medieval erathe eagle is the patron animal of the ancient greek god zeus in particular zeus was said to have taken the form of an eagle in order to abduct ganymede and there are numerous artistic depictions of the eagle zeus bearing ganymede aloft from classical times up to the present

compares those who wait on the lord to flying eagles and psalm 103 mentions renewing ones youth as the eagle in explaining this rejuvenation augustine of hippo says in his commentary on the psalms that eagles beaks overgrow as they age and that they break them against rocks to restore them the translation however is uncertain the word in the hebrew נשר can also be translated vulture and is listed alongside specific kinds of vulture in leviticus discussion of unclean animalsthe eagle is also often used in christian iconography to represent the gospel of john and eagleshaped lecterns are common in anglican and some roman catholic churches the eagle was believed to be able to look directly into the sun in the same way that the gospel of john looks directly at jesus divinity and the

beasts whereas the lion eg england usually represents authority the eagle is the symbol of power they are particularly popular in germanic countries such as austria due to their association with the holy roman empire the eagle of the holy roman empire was twoheaded supposedly representing the two divisions east and west of the old roman empire this motif derived from the byzantine eastern roman empire was also adopted by the russian empire and is still featured in the flag of albania the roman eagle was preceded by the eagle of ptolemaic egypt and the achaemenid empire in the coat of arms of
