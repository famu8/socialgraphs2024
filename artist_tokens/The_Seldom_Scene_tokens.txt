at that venue friday nights from january 1972 through september 1977 before starting weekly performances at the birchmere music hallthe progressive bluegrass style played by the seldom scene had become increasingly popular during the 1970s especially duffeys high tenor and the vocal blend of duffeystarlingauldridge their weekly shows included bluegrass versions of country music rock and even classical pop the bands popularity soon forced them to play more than once a week —but they continued to maintain their image as being seldom seen and on several of their early album covers were photographed with the stage lights on only their feet or with their backs to the camera though the scene remained a nontouring band they were prolific recorders producing seven albums in their first five years of existence including one live album among the first live bluegrass albumsin 1977 john starling left the group to focus on his medical career and was replaced by singer and songwriter phil rosenthal whose song muddy water had been recorded by the scene on two earlier albums starling and rosenthal shared their lead vocals on the groups sixth studio album baptizing recorded in 1978 around

train on both of which mike auldridge playedthe lineup of rosenthalduffeygrayauldridgeeldridge recorded five albums of a comparable popularity to the ones with the founding members including john starling rosenthal proved to be as good lead singer as starling and his baritone voice contrasted well with duffeys high tenor extravaganzas he also wrote typically two to three songs on each of the albums and also added acoustic guitar solos to the groupin 1986 phil rosenthal and tom gray both left the band to focus on other pursuits and were replaced by lou reid and t michael coleman respectively coleman proved to be very controversial as many purists objected to his use of an electric bass in what is nominally an acoustic genre but the albums produced by the band after colemans arrival maintained the traditional appeal of any of the scenes earlier albumsreid left the band in 1992 and duffey convinced former member john starling to return to the band for the next year during that year the scene recorded the album like we used to be but starling did not wish to stay with the band long term he was replaced in 1994 by lead singer moondi kleinthroughout these changes band
