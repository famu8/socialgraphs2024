styles and genres stretching from big band crooning to pop westernthemed songs gospel rock folk jazz and blues he did not sing the soundtrack song for high noon which was sung by tex ritter but his own version with somewhat altered lyrics omitting the name of the antagonist frank miller was the one that became a bigger hit he also did not sing the theme to another show he is commonly associated with—champion the wonder horse sung by mike stewart—but released his own subsequently more popular versionlaines enduring popularity was illustrated in june 2011 when a tvadvertised compilation called hits reached no 16 on the uk albums chart the accomplishment was achieved nearly 60 years after his debut on the uk chart 64 years after his first major us hit and four years after his deathfrankie laine was born francesco paolo lovecchio on march 30 1913 to giovanni and crescenzia lovecchio née salerno his cook county illinois birth certificate no 14436 was already americanized at the time of his birth with his name written as frank lovecchio his mother as anna salerno and his father as john lovecchio with the v lower case in each instance except in the reported by section with john lo vecchio father written in his parents had emigrated from monreale sicily to chicagos near west side in little italy where his father worked at one time as the personal barber for gangster al capone laines family appears to have had several organized crime connections and young francesco was living with his grandfather when the latter was killed by rival gangstersthe eldest of eight children laine grew up in the old town neighborhood first at 1446 n north park avenue and later at 331 w schiller street and had his first taste of singing as a member of the choir in the church of the immaculate conceptions elementary school across the street from the north park avenue home he later attended lane technical high school where he helped to develop his lung power and breath control by joining the track and field and basketball teams he realized he wanted to be a singer when he missed time in school to see al jolsons current talking picture the singing fool jolson would later visit laine when both were filming pictures in 1949 and at about this time jolson remarked that laine was going to put all the other singers out of businesseven in the 1920s his vocal abilities were enough to get him noticed by a slightly older in crowd at his school who began inviting him to parties and to local dance clubs including chicagos merry garden ballroom at 17 he sang before a crowd of 5000 at the merry garden ballroom to such applause that he ended up performing five encores on his first night laine was giving dance lessons for a charity ball at the merry garden when he was called to the bandstand to singsoon i found myself on the main bandstand before this enormous crowd laine recalled i was really nervous but i started singing beside an open fireplace a popular song of the day it was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me up when i got done the tears were streaming down my cheeks and the ballroom became quiet i was very nearsighted and couldnt see the audience i thought that the people didnt like mesome of his other early influences during this period included enrico caruso carlo buti and especially bessie smith—a record of whose somehow wound up in his parents collectioni can still close my eyes and visualize its blue and purple label it was a bessie smith recording of the bleeding hearted blues with midnight blues on the other side the first time i laid the needle down on that record i felt cold chills and an indescribable excitement it was my first exposure to jazz and the blues although i had no idea at the time what to call those magical sounds i just knew i had to hear more of them — frankie laine 15 another singer who influenced him at this time was the singersongwriter gene austin generally considered the first “ crooner ” laine worked after school at a drugstore that was situated across the street from a record store that continually played hit records by austin over their loudspeakers he would swab down the windows in time to austins songs many years later laine related the story to austin when both were guests on the popular television variety show shower of stars he would also costar in a film rainbow round my shoulder with austins daughter charlotteshortly after graduating from high school laine signed on as a member of the merry gardens marathon dance company and toured with them working dance marathons during the great depression setting the world record of 3501 hours with partner ruthie smith at atlantic citys million dollar pier in 1932 still billed as frank lovecchio he would entertain the spectators during the fifteenminute breaks the dancers were given each hour during his marathon days he worked with several upandcoming entertainers including rose marie red skelton and a 14yearold anita oday for whom he served as a mentor as noted by laine in a 1998 interview by david millerother artists whose styles began to influence laine at this time were bing crosby louis armstrong as a trumpet player billie holiday mildred bailey and later nat king cole laine befriended cole in los angeles when the latters career was just beginning to gain momentum cole recorded a song it only happens once that fledgling songwriter laine had composed they remained close friends throughout the remainder of coles life and laine was one of the pallbearers at coles funeralin 1937 he replaced perry como in the freddy carlone band in cleveland como made a call to carlone about laine como was another lifelong friend of laines who once lent him the money to travel to a possible giglaines rhythmic style was illsuited to the sweet sounds of the carlone band and the two soon parted company success continued to elude laine and he spent the next 10 years scuffling alternating between singing at small jazz clubs on both coasts and a series of jobs including those of a bouncer dance instructor used car salesman agent synthetic leather factory worker and machinist at a defense plant it was while working at the defense plant during the second world war that he first began writing songs it only happens once was written at the plant often homeless during his scuffling phases he hit the lowest point of his career when he was sleeping on a bench in central parki would sneak into hotel rooms and sleep on the floor in fact i was bodily thrown out of 11 different new york hotels i stayed in ymcas and with anyone who would let me flop eventually i was down to my last four cents and my bed became a roughened wooden bench in central park i used my four pennies to buy four tiny baby ruth candy bars and rationed myself to one a day — frankie laine 41 he changed his professional name to frankie laine in 1938 upon receiving a job singing for the new york city radio station wins the program director jack coombs thought that lovecchio was too foreign sounding and too much of a mouthful for the studio announcers so he americanized it to lane an homage to his high school he added the i to avoid confusion with a girl singer at the station who went by the name of frances lane it was at this time that laine got unknown singer helen oconnell her job with the jimmy dorsey band wins deciding that they no longer needed a jazz singer dropped him with the help of bandleader jean goldkette he got a job with a sustainer nonsponsored radio show at nbc as he was about to start germany attacked poland and all sustainer broadcasts were pulled off the air in deference to the needs of the militarylaine next found employment in a munitions plant at a salary of 15000 a week he quit singing for what was perhaps the fifth or sixth time of his already long career while working at the plant he met a trio of girl singers and became engaged to the lead singer the group had been noticed by johnny mercers capitol records and convinced laine to head out to hollywood with them as their agentin 1943 he moved to california where he sang in the background of several films including the harvey girls and dubbed the singing voice for an actor in the danny kaye comedy the kid from brooklyn it was in los angeles in 1944 that he met and befriended disc jockey al jarvis and composerpianist carl t fischer the latter of whom was to be his songwriting partner musical director and piano accompanist until his death in 1954 their songwriting collaborations included id give my life baby just for me what could be sweeter forever more and the jazz standard well be together againwhen the war ended laine soon found himself scuffling again and was eventually given a place to stay by jarvis jarvis also did his best to help promote the struggling singers career and laine soon had a small regional following in the meantime laine would make the rounds of the bigger jazz clubs hoping that the featured band would call him up to perform a number with them in late 1946 hoagy carmichael heard him singing at billy bergs club in los angeles and this was when success finally arrived not knowing that carmichael was in the audience laine sang the carmichaelpenned standard rockin chair when slim gaillard called him up to the stage to sing this eventually led to a contract with the newly established mercury records laine and carmichael would later collaborate on a song put yourself in my place babylaine cut his first record in 1944 for a fledgling company called beltone records the sides were called in the wee small hours of the morning an uptempo number not to be confused with the frank sinatra recording of the same name and a wartime propaganda tune entitled brother thats liberty though the records failed to make much of an impression the label soon folded and laine was picked up by atlas records a race label that initially hired him to imitate his friend nat king cole cole would occasionally moonlight for other labels under pseudonyms while under contract to capitol and as he had previously recorded some sides for atlas they reasoned that fans would assume that frankie laine was yet another pseudonym for colelaine cut his first two numbers for atlas in the king mode backed by rb artist johnny moores group the three blazers which featured charles brown and coles guitarist from the king cole trio oscar moore the ruse worked and the record sold moderately well although limited to the race market laine cut the remainder of his songs for atlas in his own style including standards such as roses of picardy and moonlight in vermontit was also at this time that he recorded a single for mercury records pickle in the middle with the mustard on top and i may be wrong but i think youre wonderful he appears only as a character actor on the first side which features the comedic singing of artie auerbach aka mr kitzel who was a featured player on the jack benny radio show in it laine plays a peanut vendor at a ball game and can be heard shouting out lines like its a munchy crunchy bag of lunchy the flip side features laine and is a jazzy version of an old standard done as a rhythm number it was played by laines friend disc jockey al jarvis and gained the singer a small west coast followingeven after his discovery by carmichael laine still was considered only an intermission act at billy bergs he reached his first independent success when he dusted off a fifteenyearold song that few people remembered in 1946 thats my desire laine had picked up the song from singer june hart a half a dozen years earlier when he sang at the college inn in cleveland he introduced desire as a new song—meaning new to his repertoire at bergs—but the audience mistook it for a new song that had just been written he ended up singing it five times that night after that laine quickly became the star attraction at bergs and record company executives took notelaine soon had patrons lining up to hear him sing desire among them was rb artist hadda brooks known for her boogie woogie piano playing she listened to him every night and eventually cut her own version of the song which became a hit on the harlem charts i liked the way he did it brooks recalled he sings with soul he sings the way he feelshe was soon recording for the fledgling mercury label and thats my desire was one of the songs cut in his first recording session there it quickly took the no 3 spot on the rb chart and listeners initially thought laine was blackthe record also made it to the no 4 spot on the mainstream chart although it was quickly covered by many other artists including sammy kaye who took it to the no 2 spot it was laines version that became the standarddesire became laines first gold record having sold over one million copies and established him in the music world he had been over 7000 in debt on the day before he recorded this song his first paycheck for royalties was over five times this amount laine paid off all of his debts except one—fellow singer perry como refused to let laine pay him back and would kid him about the money owed for years to come the loan to laine during the time when both men were still struggling singers was one of the few secrets como kept from his wife roselle who learned of it many years later a series of hit singles quickly followed including black and blue mamselle two loves have i shine on the sunny side of the street monday again and many othersoriginally a rhythm and bluesinfluenced jazz singer laine later branched out into a number of a genres including popular standards gospel folk country westernamericana rock n roll and the occasional novelty number he was also known as mr rhythm for his driving jazzy stylelaine was part of a new breed of singers who rose to prominence in the post–world war ii era this new raw emotionally charged style seemed at the time to signal the end of the previous eras singing styles and was indeed a harbinger of the rock n roll music that was to come as music historian jonny whiteside wrotein the hollywood clubs a new breed of performers laid down a baffling hip array of new soundsmost important of all these though was frankie laine a big lad with steel tonsils who belted out torch blues while stomping his size twelve foot in joints like billy bergs club hangover and the bandboxlaines intense vocal style owed nothing to crosby sinatra or dick haymes instead he drew from billy eckstine big joe turner jimmy rushing and with it laine had sown the seeds from which an entire new perception and audience would growfrank sinatra represented perhaps the highest flowering of a quarter century tradition of crooning but suddenly found himself an anachronism first frankie laine then tony bennett and now johnnie ray dubbed the belters and the exciters came along with a brash vibrancy and vulgar beat that made the old bandstand routine which frank meticulously perfected seem almost invalidin the words of jazz critic richard grudensfranks style was very innovative which was why he had such difficulty with early acceptance he would bend notes and sing about the chordal context of a note rather than to sing the note directly and he stressed each rhythmic downbeat which was different from the smooth balladeer of his timehis 1946 recording of thats my desire remains a landmark record signaling the end of both the dominance of the big bands and the crooning styles favored by contemporary dick haymes and others often called the first of the blueeyed soul singers 82 laines style cleared the way for many artists who arose in the late 1940s and early 1950s including kay starr tony bennett and johnnie rayi think that frank probably was one of the forerunner ofblues ofrock n roll a lot of singers who sing with a passionate demeanor—frank was and is definitely that i always used to love to mimic him with thatsmydesire and then later johnnie ray came along that made all of those kind of movements but frank had already done them – patti pagethroughout the 1950s laine enjoyed a second career singing the title songs over the opening credits of hollywood films and television shows including gunfight at the ok corral 310 to yuma bullwhip and rawhide his rendition of the title song for mel brookss 1974 hit movie blazing saddles won an oscar nomination for best song and on television laines featured recording of rawhide for the series of the same name became a popular theme songyou cant categorize him hes one of those singers thats not in one track and yet and still i think that his records had more excitement and life into it and i think that was his big selling point that he was so full of energy you know when you hear his records it was dynamite energy — herb jeffrieslaine was a jazz singer in the late 1940s accompanied by carl fischer and some of the best jazz men in the business he was singing standards like by the river sainte marie black and blue rockin chair west end blues at the end of the road aint that just like a woman that aint right exactly like you shine and sleepy ol river on the mercury labelhe enjoyed his greatest success after impresario mitch miller who became the ar man at mercury in 1948 recognized a universal quality in his voice that led to a succession of charttopping popular songs often with a folk or western flavor laine and miller became a formidable hitmaking team whose first collaboration that lucky old sun became the number one song in the country three weeks after its release it was also laines fifth gold record that lucky old sun was something new to the musical scene in 1949 a folk spiritual which as interpreted by laine became both an affirmation of faith and a working mans wish to bring his earthly sufferings to an endthe song was knocked down to the number two position by laine and millers second collaboration mule train which proved an even bigger hit making laine the first artist to hold the number one and two positions simultaneously mule train with its whip cracks and echo has been cited as the first song to use an aural texture that set the pattern for virtually the entire first decade of rockmule train represents a second direction in which laines music would be simultaneously heading under the guidance of mitch miller as the voice of the great outdoors and the american west mule train is a slice of life in the mid19th century west in which the contents of the packages being delivered by the mule train provide a snapshot into frontier life theres some cotton thread and needles for the folks away up yondera shovel for a miner who left his home to wandersome rheumatism pills for the settlers in the hillsthe collaboration producing a run of top forty hits that lasted into the early years of the rock and roll era other hits included dream a little dream of me stars and stripes forever the cry of the wild goose swamp girl satan wears a satin gown and music maestro pleaseshine written in 1910 by cecil mack rc mcpherson a groundbreaking africanamerican songwriter and publisher was believed to be based on a reallife friend of vaudevillian george walker who was with him during the new york city race riots of 1900 the song takes what was then an ethnic slur shine and turns it into something to be proud of it had been a hit for laines idol louis armstrong who would cover several of laines hits as wellsatan wears a satin gown is the prototype of another recurring motif in laines oeuvre the lorelei or jezebel song both of which would be the titles of later laine records the song which has a loosely structured melody that switches in tone and rhythm throughout was pitched to laine by a young song plugger tony benedetto who would later go on to achieve success as tony bennett laine recognized the younger singers talent and gave him encouragementswamp girl is another entry with the loreleijezebel motif in the laine songbook in this decidedly gothic tale of a ghostly female spirit who inhabits a metaphorical swamp the femme fatale attempts to lure the singer to his death calling come to the deep where your sleep is without a dream the swamp girl is voiced in an obligato by coloratura loulie jean norman who would later go on to provide a similar vocal for the theme song of the television series star trek the coloratura contrasts well with laines rough masculine voice and disembodied female voices would continue to appear in the background of many of his records to great effectthe cry of the wild goose would be laines last number one hit on the american charts it was written by folksinger terry gilkyson of the easy riders fame gilkyson would write many more songs for laine over the next decade and he and the easy riders would back him on the hit single love is a golden ring the cry of the wild goose falls into the voice of the great outdoors category of laine songs with the opening line of its chorus my heart knows what the wild goose knows becoming a part of the american lexiconlaines influence on todays music can be clearly evidenced in his rendition of the hoagy carmichael standard georgia on my mind laines slow soulful version was a model for the iconic remake by ray charles a decade later charles would follow up georgia with remakes of other frankie laine hits including your cheatin heart and that lucky old sun elvis presley also remade several of laines hits and his early influence on the beatles has been well documentedin an interview mitch miller described the basis of laines appealhe was my kind of guy he was very dramatic in his singingand you must remember that in those days there were no videos so you had to depend on the image that the record made in the listeners ears and thats why many fine artists were not good record sellers for instance lena horne fabulous artist but she never sold many records till that last album of hers but she would always sell out the house no matter where she was and there were others who sold a lot of records but couldnt get to first base in personal appearances but frankie had it both — mitch millerbut the biggest label of all was columbia records and in 1950 mitch miller left mercury to embark upon his phenomenally successful career as the ar man there laines contract at mercury would be up for renewal the following year and miller soon brought laine to columbia as well laines contract with columbia was the most lucrative in the industry until rca bought elvis presleys contract five years laterlaine began recording for columbia records in 1951 where he immediately scored a doublesided hit with the single jezebel 2rose rose i love you 3 other laine hits from this period include high noon do not forsake me 5 jealousy jalousie 3 the girl in the wood 23 when youre in love 30 way down yonder in new orleans with jo stafford 26 your cheatin heart 18 granada 17 hey joe 6 the kids last fight 20 cool water some day 14 a woman in love 19 love is a golden ring with the easy riders 10 and moonlight gambler 3one of the signature songs of the early 1950s jezebel takes the lorelei motif to its end with laine shouting jezebel at the woman who has destroyed him in laines words the song uses flamenco rhythms to whip up an atmosphere of sexual frustration and hatred while a guy berated the woman whod done him wrong 113 high noon was the theme song from the western motion picture starring gary cooper and grace kelly it had been sung by cowboy star tex ritter in the film but it was laines recording that became the big hit from this point on laine would sing the theme songs over the opening credits of many hollywood and television westerns becoming so identified with these title songs that mel brooks would hire him to sing the theme song for his classic cult film western spoof blazing saddlesat this time laine had become more popular in the united kingdom than in the us as many of his hit records in the uk were only minor hits in his native country songs like the gandy dancers ball the rock of gibraltar and answer me o lord were much bigger hits for him abroad answer me would later provide the inspiration for paul mccartneys composition yesterday it was also there that he broke attendance records when appearing at the palladium where he launched his first successful television series with singer connie hainesmitch miller teamed laine with many of mercury and columbias biggest artists he scored hits with patti page i love you for that at mercury doris day sugarbush jo stafford hey good lookin gambella the gambling lady hambone floatin down to cotton town settin the woods on fire and many others jimmy boyd tell me a story the little boy and the old man the four lads rain rain rain and johnnie ray up above my head i hear music in the airlaine scored a total of 39 hit records on the charts while at columbia and many of his songs from this period are most readily associated with him his greatest hits album released in 1957 has been a perennial best seller that has never gone out of print his songs at columbia included everything from pop and jazz standards novelties gospel spirituals rb numbers country western folk rock n roll calypso foreign language childrens music film and television themes tangos light operetta his vocal style could range anywhere from shouting out lines to rhythm numbers to romantic balladsboth in collaboration with jo stafford and as a solo artist laine was one of the earliest and most frequent columbia artists to bring country numbers into the mainstream late in his career laine would go on to record two straight country albums a country laine and the nashville connection that would fully demonstrate his ability to inflect multiple levels of emotional nuances into a line or word many of his popcountry hits from the early 1950s featured the steel guitar playing of speedy west who played a custombuilt threeneck fourpedal modelhis duets with doris day were folkpop adaptations of traditional south african folk songs translated by folk singer josef marais marais would also provide laine and jo stafford with a similar translation of a song which stafford seems to have particularly disliked called chow willy although sugarbush brought laine day a gold record they would never team up againin 1953 he set two more records this time on the uk charts weeks at no 1 for a song i believe which held the number one spot for 18 weeks and weeks at no 1 for an artist in a single year 27 weeks when hey joe and answer me o lord became number one hits as well in spite of the popularity of rock and roll artists such as elvis presley and the beatles fiftyplus years later both of laines records still holdin 1954 laine gave a royal command performance for queen elizabeth ii which he cites as one of the highlights of his career by the end of the decade he remained far ahead of elvis presley as the most successful artist on the british charts i believe is listed as the second most popular song of all time on the british charts as welli believe marked yet another direction for laines music that of the spiritual a devout roman catholic from childhood laine would continue to record songs of faith and inspiration throughout his career beginning with his rocking gospel album with the four lads which along with the hit song rain rain rain included renditions of such songs as remember me didnt he moan i feel like my time aint long and i hear the angels singing other laine spirituals would include my friend in the beginning make me a child again my god and i and hey hey jesusin 1953 laine recorded his first long playing album that was released domestically solely as an album prior to this his albums had been compiled from previously released singles the album was titled mr rhythm as laine was often known at that time and featured many jazzflavored rhythm numbers similar in style to his work on the mercury label the albums songlist was made up of great american songbook standards the tracks were some day sweetheart a hundred years from today laughing at life lullaby in rhythm willow weep for me my ohio home judy and after youve gone the final number features a rare vocal duet with his accompanistmusical director carl fischer paul westons orchestra provided the musicreleased as a 10 in 1953 and a 12 in 1954 this album features the talents of laine jo stafford and bandleader paul weston a tommy dorsey alumnus who led one of the top bands of the 1950s and was the husband of stafford the album was a mix of solo recordings and duets by the two stars and of new and previously released material including staffords hits single make love to me shrimp boats and jambalaya laine and stafford duetted on way down yonder in new orleans floatin down to cotton town and basin street blues and laine soloed on new orleans not to be confused with new orleans aka the house of the rising sun which laine later recorded do you know what it means to miss new orleans and when its sleepy time down south along with a pair of cuts taken from his mr rhythm albumthis album

charles thompson the tracks included several songs that had long been a standard part of the laine repertoire over the years sposin baby baby all the time and roses of picardy along with standards such as stars fell on alabama that old feeling and taking a chance on love the album proved popular with jazz and popular music fans and was often cited by laine as his personal favorite an improvised tone is apparent throughout with laine at one point reminiscing with one of the musicians about the days they performed together at billy bergsthe four lads bernie toorish jimmy arnold frank busseri and connie codarini were a canadianbased group who first gained fame as the backup singer on johnnie rays early chartbusters cry the little white cloud that cried but garnered a following of their own

last four tracks were recorded during a later sessionone of laines most popular albums this album reset several of his former hits in a driving brassy orchestration by paul weston and his orchestra two of the remakes that lucky old sun and well be together again have gone on to become the bestknown versions of the songs supplanting the original hit versions other songs on this album include rockin chair by the river sainte marie black and blue blue turning grey over you shine and west end blues the albums title is less a reference to rock and roll than a reference to the duke ellington song of that same name unlike mitch miller laine liked the new musical form known as rock n roll and was anxious to try his hand at itfrench composerarranger michel legrand teamed up with laine to record a pair of albums in 1958 the first a foreign affair was built around the concept of recording the tracks in different languages english french spanish and portuguese the album produced a pair of international hits la paloma in argentina and não tem solucão in brazil other tracks included mona lisa mamselle torna a sorriento besame mucho and autumn leaveslaine and legrand teamed up for a

got it bad and that aint good its the talk of the town and body and soul as with his legrand album he sings the entire lyric for each songa second collaboration with comstock also recorded in 1958 focused on intimacy conceived as a love letter to his second wife actress nan grey who appears on the cover with him you are my love is easily laines most romantic work his voice was once described by a british disk jockey as having the virility of a goat and the delicacy of a flower petal and both these elements are well showcased here particularly the delicate nuances his recording of the wedding standard because exemplifies the singers delicate mode at its most exquisite he opens the song a cappella after which a classical acoustic guitar joins him with the full orchestra gradually fading in and out before the guitar only climax also among the love ballads on this album are versions of i married an angel to my wife try a little tenderness side by side and a version of the touch of your lipsrecorded in 1959 balladeer was a folkblues album laine had helped pioneer the folk music movement a full ten years earlier with his hit folkpop records penned by terry gilkyson et al this album

inspired the lucy d in one of the songs other songs are by folk country and blues artists such as brownie mcghee james a bland huddie leadbelly ledbetter and hungarian composer rudolf friml the closing track and doesnt she roll cowritten by laine with its rhythmic counterchorus in the background foretells paul simons graceland album two decades laterincluded are renditions of rocks and

the animals a few years laterlaines last four albums at columbia hell bent for leather deuces wild call of the wild and wanderlust were arranged by a young john williams williams recently said the following words about lainefrankie laine was somebody that everybody knew he was a kind of a household word like frank sinatra or bobby darin or peggy lee or ella fitzgerald—frankie laine was one of the great popular singers and stylists of that timeand his stylehe was one of those artists who had such a unique stamp—nobody sounded like he did you could hear two notes and you knew who it was and you were right on the beam with it right away and of course that defines a successful popular artist at least at that time these people were all uniquely individual and frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his identifiability — john williamsthis album of western classics by laine established him as a cowboy singer for many young fans who grew up in the 1960s the albums title is taken from a line in the popular television theme song laine recorded for the popular eric flemingclint eastwood western rawhide which appears on the album the tracks include stereo remakes of several of his biggest westerngreat outdoors hits the cry of the wild goose mule train gunfight at ok corral and the 310 to yuma as well as new material including the western rocker wanted man and a musical narrative bowie knifelaines next album continued with the western theme on several of the numbers while following up on his last hit single moonlight gambler a stereo remake of which appears on the album most of the tracks of this album feature a gambling theme the hard way is a story about a hardluck case who is killed by a cannonball while fighting in the civil war for the confederacy only to wind up eternally shoveling coal in hell the second track is stephen fosters camptown races other songs on this album include luck be a lady from the hit musical guys and dolls which laine performed in an off broadway touring company version of get rich quick horses and women which laine may have supplied the lyrics to deuces wild for which laine provided the lyrics and dead mans handthis album continued to play up chicagoborn laines western image with songs such as on the trail based on the composition by ferde grofé and tumbling tumbleweeds written by one of the founding members of the sons of the pioneers bob nolan the majority of its tracks focus more however on the great outdoors with titles such as song of the open road north to alaska beyond the blue horizon rolling stone and the new frontier which appears to show laines support of president john f kennedy the arrangements on many of these songs have an almost classical feel to them reflecting the classical training of john williams who would go on to conduct the boston pops for many yearswanderlust was laines final album with columbia records de glory road
