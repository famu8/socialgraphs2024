songs and he loved records by other country singers such as roy acuff ernest tubb ted daffan jimmie rodgers jimmie davis and bob wills the southern gospel singer jake hess one of his favorite performers was a significant influence on his balladsinging style presley was a regular audience member at the monthly allnight singings downtown where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of african american spirituals presley listened to regional radio stations such as wdia that played what were then called race records spirituals blues and the modern backbeatheavy rhythm and blues like some of his peers he may have attended blues venues only on nights designated for exclusively white audiences many of his future recordings were inspired by local africanamerican musicians such as arthur crudup and rufus thomas bb king recalled that he had known presley before he was popular when they both used to frequent beale street by the time he graduated high school in june 1953 presley had singled out music as his futurein august 1953 presley checked into memphis recording service the company run by sam phillips before he started sun records he aimed to pay for studio time to record a twosided acetate disc my happiness and thats when your heartaches begin he later claimed that he intended the record as a birthday gift for his mother or that he was merely interested in what he sounded like biographer peter guralnick argued that presley chose sun in the hope of being discovered in january 1954 presley cut a second acetate at sun—ill never stand in your way and it wouldnt be the same without you—but again nothing came of it not long after he failed an audition for a local vocal quartet the songfellows and another for the band of eddie bondphillips meanwhile was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom sun focused in june he acquired a demo recording by jimmy sweeney of a ballad without you that he thought might suit presley the teenaged singer came by the studio but was unable to do it justice despite this phillips asked presley to sing other numbers and was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians guitarist winfield scotty moore and upright bass player bill black to work with presley for a recording session the session held the evening of july 5 proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night as they were about to abort and go home presley launched into a 1946 blues number arthur crudups thats all right moore recalled all of a sudden elvis just started singing this song jumping around and acting the fool and then bill picked up his bass and he started acting the fool too and i started playing with them phillips quickly began taping this was the sound he had been looking for three days later popular memphis disc jockey dewey phillips no relation to sam phillips played thats all right on his red hot and blue show listener interest was such that phillips played the record repeatedly during the remaining two hours of his show interviewing presley onair phillips asked him what high school he attended to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed that he was black during the next few days the trio recorded a bluegrass song bill monroes blue moon of kentucky again in a distinctive style and employing a juryrigged echo effect that sam phillips dubbed slapback a single was pressed with thats all right on the aside and blue moon of kentucky on the reversethe trio played publicly for the first time at the bon air club on july 17 1954 later that month they appeared at the overton park shell with slim whitman headlining here elvis pioneered rubber legs his signature dance movement a combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness led presley to shake his legs as he performed his widecut pants emphasized his movements causing young women in the audience to start screaming moore recalled during the instrumental parts he would back off from the mic and be playing and shaking and the crowd would just go wildsoon after moore and black left their old band to play with presley regularly and disc jockeypromoter bob neal became the trios manager from august through october they played frequently at the eagles nest club a dance venue in memphis when presley played teenagers rushed from the pool to fill the club then left again as the house western swing band resumed presley quickly grew more confident on stage according to moore his movement was a natural thing but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction hed do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick amid these live performances presley returned to sun studio for more recording sessions presley made what would be his only appearance on nashvilles grand ole opry on october 2 opry manager jim denny told phillips that his singer was not bad but did not suit the programin november 1954 presley performed on louisiana hayride—the oprys chief and more adventurous rival the show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states his nervous first set drew a muted reaction a more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response soon after the show the hayride engaged presley for a years worth of saturdaynight appearances trading in his old guitar for 8 he purchased a martin instrument for 175 equivalent to 2000 in 2023 and his trio began playing in new locales including houston texas and texarkana arkansas presley made his first television appearance on the kslatv broadcast of louisiana hayride soon after he failed an audition for arthur godfreys talent scouts on the cbs television network by early 1955 presleys regular hayride appearances constant touring and wellreceived record releases had made him a regional starin january neal signed a formal management contract with presley and brought him to the attention of colonel tom parker whom he considered the best promoter in the music business having successfully managed the top country star eddy arnold parker was working with the new numberone country singer hank snow parker booked presley on snows february tourby august sun had released ten sides credited to elvis presley scotty and bill the latest recordings included a drummer some of the songs like thats all right were in what one memphis journalist described as the rb idiom of negro field jazz others like blue moon of kentucky were more in the country field but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both this blend of styles made it difficult for presleys music to find radio airplay according to neal many countrymusic disc jockeys would not play it because presley sounded too much like a black artist and none of the rb stations would touch him because he sounded too much like a hillbilly the blend came to be known as rockabilly at the time presley was billed as the king of western bop the hillbilly cat and the memphis flashpresley renewed neals management contract in august 1955 simultaneously appointing parker as his special adviser the group maintained an extensive touring schedule neal recalled it was almost frightening the reaction that came to elvis from the teenaged boys so many of them through some sort of jealousy would practically hate him there were occasions in some towns in texas when wed have to be sure to have a police guard because somebodyd always try to take a crack at him the trio became a quartet when hayride drummer fontana joined as a full member in midoctober they played a few shows in support of bill haley whose rock around the clock track had been a numberone hit the previous year haley observed that presley had a natural feel for rhythm and advised him to sing fewer balladsat the country disc jockey convention in early november presley was voted the years most promising male artist after three major labels made offers of up to 25000 parker and phillips struck a deal with rca victor on november 21 to acquire presleys sun contract for an unprecedented 40000 presley aged 20 was legally still a minor so his father signed the contract parker arranged with the owners of hill range publishing jean and julian aberbach to create two entities elvis presley music and gladys music to handle all the new material recorded by presley songwriters were obliged to forgo onethird of their customary royalties in exchange for having presley perform their compositions by december rca had begun to heavily promote its new singer and before months end had reissued many of his sun recordingson january 10 1956 presley made his first recordings for rca victor in nashville extending his bynow customary backup of moore black fontana and hayride pianist floyd cramer—who had been performing at live club dates with presley—rca victor enlisted guitarist chet atkins and three background singers including gordon stoker of the popular jordanaires quartet the session produced the moody heartbreak hotel released as a single on january 27 parker brought presley to national television booking him on cbss stage show for six appearances over two months the program produced in new york city was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers tommy and jimmy dorsey after his first appearance on january 28 presley stayed in town to record at rca victors new york studio the sessions yielded eight songs including a cover of carl perkins rockabilly anthem blue suede shoes in february presleys i forgot to remember to forget a sun recording released the previous august reached the top of the billboard country chart neals contract was terminated and parker became presleys managerrca victor released presleys selftitled debut album on march 23 joined by five previously unreleased sun recordings its seven recently recorded tracks included two country songs a bouncy pop tune and what would centrally define the evolving sound of rock and roll blue suede shoes—an improvement over perkins in almost every way according to critic robert hilburn—and three rb numbers that had been part of presleys stage repertoire covers of little richard ray charles and the drifters as described by hilburn these were the most revealing of all unlike many white artists who watered down the gritty edges of the original rb versions of songs in the 50s presley reshaped them he not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar not piano the lead instrument in all three cases it became the first rock and roll album to top the billboard chart a position it held for ten weeks while presley was not an innovative guitarist like moore or contemporary african american rockers bo diddley and chuck berry cultural historian gilbert b rodman argued that the albums cover image of elvis having the time of his life on stage with a guitar in his hands played a crucial role in positioning the guitar as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new musicon april 3 presley made the first of two appearances on nbcs the milton berle show his performance on the deck of the uss hancock in san diego california prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates a few days later presley and his band were flying to nashville tennessee for a recording session when an engine died and the plane almost went down over arkansas twelve weeks after its original release heartbreak hotel became presleys first numberone pop hit in late april presley began a twoweek residency at the new frontier hotel and casino on the las vegas strip the shows were poorly received by the conservative middleaged hotel guests like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party a newsweek critic wrote amid his vegas tenure presley who had acting ambitions signed a sevenyear contract with paramount pictures he began a tour of the midwest in midmay covering fifteen cities in as many days he had attended several shows by freddie bell and the bellboys in vegas and was struck by their cover of hound dog a hit in 1953 for blues singer big mama thornton by songwriters jerry leiber and mike stoller it became his new closing numberafter a show in la crosse wisconsin an urgent message on the letterhead of the local catholic dioceses newspaper was sent to fbi director j edgar hoover it warned that presley is a definite danger to the security of the united states actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth after the show more than 1000 teenagers tried to gang into presleys room at the auditorium indications of the harm presley did just in la crosse were the two high school girls whose abdomen and thigh had presleys autographpresleys second milton berle show appearance came on june 5 at nbcs hollywood studio amid another hectic tour milton berle persuaded presley to leave his guitar backstage during the performance presley abruptly halted an uptempo rendition of hound dog and launched into a slow grinding version accentuated with exaggerated body movements his gyrations created a storm of controversy jack gould of the new york times wrote mr presley has no discernible singing ability his phrasing if it can be called that consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginners aria in a bathtub his one specialty is an accented movement of the body primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway ben gross of the new york daily news opined that popular music has reached its lowest depths in the grunt and groin antics of one elvis presley elvis who rotates his pelvis gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos ed sullivan whose variety show was the nations most popular declared presley unfit for family viewing to presleys displeasure he soon found himself being referred to as elvis the pelvis which he called childishthe berle shows drew such high ratings that presley was booked for a july 1 appearance on nbcs the steve allen show in new york allen no fan of rock and roll introduced a new elvis in a white bowtie and black tails presley sang hound dog for less than a minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bowtie as described by television historian jake austen allen thought presley was talentless and absurd set things up so that presley would show his contrition allen later wrote that he found presleys strange gangly countryboy charisma his hardtodefine cuteness and his charming eccentricity intriguing and worked him into the comedy fabric of his program just before the final rehearsal for the show presley told a reporter i dont want to do anything to make people dislike me i think tv is important so im going to go along but i wont be able to give the kind of show i do in a personal appearance presley would refer back to the allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career later that night he appeared on hy gardner calling a popular local television show pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism of him presley responded no i havent i dont see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when its only music how would rock n roll music make anyone rebel against their parentsthe next day presley recorded hound dog any way you want me and dont be cruel the jordanaires sang harmony as they had on the steve allen show they would work with presley through the 1960s a few days later presley made an outdoor concert appearance in memphis at which he announced you know those people in new york are not gon na change me none im gon na show you what the real elvis is like tonight in august a judge in jacksonville florida ordered presley to tame his act throughout the following performance he largely kept still except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order the single pairing dont be cruel with hound dog ruled the top of the charts for eleven weeks—a mark that would not be surpassed for thirtysix years recording sessions for presleys second album took place in hollywood in early september leiber and stoller the writers of hound dog contributed love meallens show with presley had for the first time beaten the ed sullivan show in the ratings sullivan booked presley for three appearances for an unprecedented 50000 the first on september 9 1956 was seen by approximately 60 million viewers—a record 826 percent of the television audience actor charles laughton hosted the show filling in while sullivan was recovering from a car accident according to legend presley was shot only from the waist up watching clips of the allen and berle shows sullivan had opined that presley got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants—so when he moves his legs back and forth you can see the outline of his cock i think its a coke bottle we just cant have this on a sunday night this is a family show sullivan publicly told tv guide as for his gyrations the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots in fact presley was shown headtotoe though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut with legconcealing closeups when he danced the studio audience reacted with screams presleys performance of his forthcoming single the ballad love me tender prompted a recordshattering million advance orders more than any other single event it was this first appearance on the ed sullivan show that made presley a national celebrityaccompanying presleys rise to fame a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize the historian marty jezer wrote that presley began the biggest pop craze since glenn miller and frank sinatra and brought rock and roll to mainstream culture as presley set the artistic pace other artists followed presley more than anyone else gave the young a belief in themselves as a distinct and somehow unified generation—the first in america ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culturethe audience response at presleys live shows became increasingly fevered moore recalled hed start out you aint nothin but a hound dog and theyd just go to pieces theyd always react the same way thered be a riot every time at the two concerts he performed in september at the mississippi–alabama fair and dairy show fifty national guardsmen were added to the police detail to prevent a ruckus elvis presleys second rca victor album was released in october and quickly rose to number one the album includes old shep which he sang at the talent show in 1945 and which now marked the first time he played piano on an rca victor session according to guralnick the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm showed the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique assessing the musical and cultural impact of presleys recordings from thats all right through elvis rock critic dave marsh wrote that these records more than any others contain the seeds of what rock roll was has been and most likely what it may foreseeably becomepresley returned to the ed sullivan show hosted this time by its namesake on october 28 after the performance crowds in nashville and st louis burned him in effigy his first motion picture love me tender was released on november 21 though he was not topbilled the films original title—the reno brothers—was changed to capitalize on his latest numberone record love me tender had hit the top of the charts earlier that month to further take advantage of presleys popularity four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role the film was panned by critics but did very well at the box office presley would receive top billing on every subsequent film he madeon december 4 presley dropped into sun records where carl perkins and jerry lee lewis were recording and had an impromptu jam session along with johnny cash though phillips no longer had the right to release any presley material he made sure that the session was captured on tape the results none officially released for twentyfive years became known as the million dollar quartet recordings the year ended with a frontpage story in the wall street journal reporting that presley merchandise had brought in 22 million on top of his record sales and billboards declaration that he had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted in his first full year at rca victor then the record industrys largest company presley had accounted for over fifty percent of the labels singles salespresley made his third and final ed sullivan show appearance on january 6 1957—on this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist some commentators have claimed that parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity in any event as critic greil marcus describes presley did not tie himself down leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha if not a harem girl from the makeup over his eyes the hair falling in his face the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth he was playing rudolph valentino in the sheik with all stops out to close displaying his range and defying sullivans wishes presley sang a gentle black spiritual peace in the valley at the end of the show sullivan declared presley a real decent fine boy two days later the memphis draft board announced that presley would be classified 1a and would probably be drafted sometime that yeareach of the three presley singles released in the first half of 1957 went to number one too much all shook up and let me be your teddy bear already an international star he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released the new york times reported that pressings of his music on discarded xray plates were commanding high prices in leningrad presley purchased his 18room mansion graceland on march 19 1957 before the purchase elvis recorded loving you—the soundtrack to his second film which was released in july it was his third straight numberone album the title track was written by leiber and stoller who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for jailhouse rock presleys next film the songwriting team effectively produced the jailhouse sessions and developed a close working relationship with presley who came to regard them as his goodluck charm he was fast said leiber any demo you gave him he knew by heart in ten minutes the title track became another numberone hit as was the jailhouse rock eppresley undertook three brief tours during the year continuing to generate a crazed audience response a detroit newspaper suggested that the trouble with going to see elvis presley is that youre liable to get killed villanova students pelted the singer with eggs in philadelphia and in vancouver the crowd rioted after the show ended destroying the stage frank sinatra who had inspired the swooning and screaming of teenage girls in the 1940s decried rock and roll as brutal ugly degenerate vicious it fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people it smells phoney and false it is sung played and written for the most part by cretinous goons this rancidsmelling aphrodisiac i deplore asked for a response presley said i admire the man he has a right to say what he wants to say he is a great success and a fine actor but i think he shouldnt have said it this is a trend just the same as he faced when he started years agoleiber and stoller were again in the studio for the recording of elvis christmas album toward the end of the session they wrote a song on the spot at presleys request santa claus is back in town an innuendoladen blues the holiday release stretched presleys string of numberone albums to four and would become the bestselling christmas album ever in the united states with eventual sales of over 20 million worldwide after the session moore and black—drawing only modest weekly salaries sharing in none of presleys massive financial success—resigned though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks lateron december 20 presley received his draft notice though he was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming film king creole a couple of weeks into the new year dont another leiber and stoller tune became presleys tenth numberone seller recording sessions for the king creole soundtrack were held in hollywood in midjanuary 1958 leiber and stoller provided three songs but it would be the last time presley and the duo

perform with presleyon march 24 1958 presley was drafted into the united states army at fort chaffee in arkansas his arrival was a major media event hundreds of people descended on presley as he

promoted to sergeant on february 11 1960while in bad nauheim presley aged 24 met 14yearold priscilla beaulieu they would marry after a sevenandahalfyear courtship in her autobiography priscilla said that presley was concerned that his 24 months in the military would ruin his career in special services he would have been able to perform and remain in touch with the public but parker had convinced him that to gain popular respect he should serve as a regular soldier media reports echoed presleys concerns about his career but rca victor producer steve sholes and freddy bienstock of hill and range had carefully prepared armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material they kept up a regular stream of successful releases between his induction and discharge presley had ten top40 hits including wear my ring around your neck the bestselling hard headed woman and one night in 1958 and now and then theres a fool such as i and the numberone a big hunk o love in 1959 rca victor also generated four albums compiling previously issued material during this period most successfully elvis golden records 1958 which hit number three on the lp chartpresley returned to the us on march 2

remarkable figures for a gospel album in february 1961 presley performed two shows in memphis for a benefit for twentyfour local charities during a luncheon preceding the event rca victor presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records a twelvehour nashville session in midmarch yielded nearly all of presleys next studio album something for everybody according to john robertson it exemplifies the nashville sound the restrained cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s presaging much of what was to come from presley over the next halfdecade the album is largely a pleasant unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been elvis birthright it would be his sixth numberone lp another benefit concert for a pearl harbor memorial was staged on march 25 in hawaii it was to be presleys last public performance for seven yearsparker had by now pushed presley into a heavy filmmaking schedule focused on formulaic modestly budgeted musical comedies presley initially insisted on pursuing higher roles but when two films in a more dramatic vein—flaming star 1960 and wild in the country 1961—were less commercially successful he reverted to the formula among the twentyseven films he made during the 1960s there were a few further exceptions his films were almost universally panned critic andrew caine dismissed them as a pantheon of bad taste nonetheless they were virtually all profitable hal wallis who produced nine declared a presley picture is the only sure thing in hollywoodof presleys films in the 1960s fifteen were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another five by soundtrack eps the films rapid production and release schedules—presley frequently starred in three a year—affected his music according to jerry leiber the soundtrack formula was already evident before presley left for the army three ballads one mediumtempo one uptempo and one break blues boogie as the decade wore on the quality of the soundtrack songs grew progressively worse julie parrish who appeared in paradise hawaiian style 1966 says that presley disliked many of the songs the jordanaires gordon stoker describes how he would retreat from the studio microphone the material was so bad that he felt like he couldnt sing it most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of doc pomus and mort shuman but by and large according to biographer jerry hopkins the numbers seemed to be written on order by men who never really understood elvis or rock and rollin the first half of the decade three of presleys soundtrack albums were ranked number one on the pop charts and a few of his most popular songs came from his films such as cant help falling in love 1961 and return to sender 1962 however the commercial returns steadily diminished from 1964 through 1968 presley had only one topten hit crying in the chapel 1965 a gospel number recorded in 1960 as for nonfilm albums between the june 1962 release of pot luck and the november 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback only one lp of new material by presley was issued the gospel album how great thou art 1967 it won him his first grammy award for best sacred performance as marsh described presley was arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time really the last rock roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songsshortly before christmas 1966 more than seven years since they first met presley proposed to priscilla beaulieu they were married on may 1 1967 in a brief ceremony in their suite at the aladdin hotel in las vegas the flow of formulaic films and assemblyline soundtracks continued it was not until october 1967 when the clambake soundtrack lp registered record low sales for a new presley album that rca victor executives recognized a problem by then of course the damage had been done as historians connie kirchberg and marc hendrickx put it elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a hasbeen to all but his most loyal fanspresleys only child lisa marie was born on february 1 1968 during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career of the eight presley singles released between january 1967 and may 1968 only two charted in the top 40 none higher than number 28 his forthcoming soundtrack album speedway would rank at number 82 parker had already shifted his plans to television he maneuvered a deal with nbc that committed the network to finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a christmas specialrecorded in late june in burbank california the special simply called elvis aired on december 3 1968 later known as the 68 comeback special the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—presleys first live performances since 1961 the live segments saw presley dressed in tight black leather singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days director and coproducer steve binder worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of christmas songs parker had originally planned the show nbcs highestrated that season captured fortytwo percent of the total viewing audience jon landau of eye magazine remarked there is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home he sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock n roll singers he moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made jim morrison green with envy marsh calls the performance one of emotional grandeur and historical resonanceby january 1969 the single if i can dream written for the special reached number 12 the soundtrack album rose into the top ten according to friend jerry schilling the special reminded presley of what he had not been able to do for years being able to choose the people being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack he was out of prison man binder said of presleys reaction i played elvis the 60minute show and he told me in the screening room steve its the greatest thing ive ever done in my life i give you my word i will never sing a song i dont believe inbuoyed by the experience of the comeback special presley engaged in a prolific series of recording sessions at american sound studio which led to the acclaimed from elvis in memphis released in june 1969 it was his first secular nonsoundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years as described by marsh it is a masterpiece in which presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years he sings country songs soul songs and rockers with real conviction a stunning achievement the album featured the hit single in the ghetto issued in april which reached number three on the pop chart—presleys first nongospel top ten hit since bossa nova baby in 1963 further hit singles were culled from the american sound sessions suspicious minds dont cry daddy and kentucky rainpresley was keen to resume regular live performing following the success of the comeback special offers came in from around the world the london palladium offered parker us28000 equivalent to 233000 in 2023 for a oneweek engagement he responded thats fine for me now how much can you get for elvis in may the brandnew international hotel in las vegas boasting the largest showroom in the city booked presley for fiftyseven shows over four weeks beginning july 31 moore fontana and the jordanaires declined to participate afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in nashville presley assembled new topnotch accompaniment led by guitarist james burton and including two gospel groups the imperials and sweet inspirations costume designer bill belew responsible for the intense leather styling of the comeback special created a new stage look for presley inspired by his passion for karate nonetheless presley was nervous his only previous las vegas engagement in 1956 had been dismal parker oversaw a major promotional push and international hotel owner kirk kerkorian arranged to send his own plane to new york to fly in rock journalists for the debut performancepresley took to the stage without introduction the audience of 2200 including many celebrities gave him a standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance a third followed his encore cant help falling in love which would be his closing number for much of his remaining life at a press conference after the show when a journalist referred to him as the king presley gestured toward fats domino who was taking in the scene no presley said thats the real king of rock and roll the next day parkers negotiations with the hotel resulted in a fiveyear contract for presley to play each february and august at an annual salary of 1 million newsweek commented there are several unbelievable things about elvis but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars rolling stone called presley supernatural his own resurrection in november presleys final nonconcert film change of habit opened the double album from memphis to vegasfrom vegas to memphis came out the same month the first lp consisted of live performances from the international the second of more cuts from the american sound sessions suspicious minds reached the top of the charts—presleys first us pop numberone in over seven years and his lastcassandra peterson later televisions elvira met presley during this period in las vegas she recalled of their encounter he was so antidrug when i met him i mentioned to him that i smoked marijuana and he was just appalled presley also rarely drank—several of his family members had been alcoholics a fate he intended to avoidpresley returned to the international early in 1970 for the first of the years twomonthlong engagements performing two shows a night recordings from these shows were issued on the album on stage in late february presley performed six attendancerecord–breaking shows at the houston astrodome in april the single the wonder of you was issued—a number one hit in the uk it topped the us adult contemporary chart as well metrogoldwynmayer mgm filmed rehearsal and concert footage at the international during august for the documentary elvis thats the way it is presley was performing in a jumpsuit which would become a trademark of his live act during this engagement he was threatened with murder unless us50000 equivalent to 392000 in 2023 was paid presley had been the target of many threats since the 1950s often without his knowledge the fbi took the threat seriously and security was increased for the next two shows presley went onstage with a derringer in his right boot and a 45 caliber pistol in his waistband but the concerts succeeded without any incidentsthats the way it is produced to accompany the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings marked a stylistic shift as music historian john robertson noted the authority of presleys singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the americanroots inspiration of the memphis sessions towards a more middleoftheroad sound with country put on the back burner and soul and rb left in memphis what was left was very classy very clean white pop—perfect for the las vegas crowd but a definite retrograde step for elvis after the end of his international engagement on september 7 presley embarked on a weeklong concert tour largely of the south his first since 1958 another weeklong tour of the west coast followed in novemberon december 21 1970 presley engineered a meeting with us president richard nixon at the white house where he explained how he believed he could reach out to the hippies to help combat the drug culture he and the president abhorred he asked nixon for a bureau of narcotics and dangerous drugs badge to signify official sanction of his efforts nixon who apparently found the encounter awkward expressed a belief that presley could send a positive message to young people and that it was therefore important that he retain his credibility presley told nixon that the beatles whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era exemplified what he saw as a trend of antiamericanism presley and his friends previously had a fourhour gettogether with the beatles at his home in bel air california in august 1965 paul mccartney later said that he felt a bit betrayed the great joke was that we were taking drugs and look what happened to him a

grammy lifetime achievement award then known as the bing crosby award three new nonfilm presley studio albums were released in 1971 best received by critics was elvis country a concept record that focused on genre standards the biggest seller was elvis sings the wonderful world of christmas according to greil marcus in the midst of ten painfully genteel christmas songs every one sung with appalling sincerity and humility one could find elvis tomcatting his way through six blazing minutes of merry christmas baby a raunchy old charles brown blues if sin was his lifelessness it was his sinfulness that brought him to lifemgm filmed presley in april 1972 for elvis on tour which went on to win the golden globe award for best documentary film for that years golden globe awards his

shows at new yorks madison square garden the evening concert on july 10 was issued in lp form a week later elvis as recorded at madison square garden became one of presleys biggestselling albums after the tour the single burning love was released—presleys last top ten hit on the us pop chart the most exciting single elvis has made since all shook up wrote rock critic robert christgaupresley and his wife had become increasingly distant barely cohabiting in 1971 an affair he had with joyce bova resulted—unbeknownst to him—in her pregnancy and an abortion he often raised the possibility of joyce moving into graceland the presleys separated on february 23 1972 after priscilla disclosed her relationship with mike stone a karate instructor presley had recommended to her priscilla related that when she told him presley forcefully made love to her declaring this is how a real man makes love to his woman she later stated in an interview that she regretted her choice of words in describing the incident and said it had been an overstatement five months later presleys new girlfriend linda thompson a songwriter and onetime memphis beauty queen moved in with him presley and his wife filed for divorce on august 18 according to joe moscheo of the imperials the failure of presleys marriage was a blow from which he never recovered at a rare press conference that june a reporter had asked presley whether he was satisfied with his image presley replied well the image is one thing and the human being another its very hard to live up to an imagein january 1973 presley performed two benefit concerts for the kui lee cancer fund in connection with a groundbreaking television special aloha from hawaii which would be the first concert by a solo artist to be aired globally the first show served as a practice run and backup should technical problems affect the live broadcast two days later on january 14 aloha from hawaii aired live via satellite to primetime audiences in japan south korea thailand the philippines australia and new zealand as well as to us servicemen based across southeast asia in japan where it capped a nationwide elvis presley week it smashed viewing records the next night it was simulcast to twentyeight european countries and in april an extended version aired in the us receiving a fiftyseven percent share of the tv audience over time parkers claim that it was seen by one billion or more people would be broadly accepted but that figure appeared to have been sheer invention presleys stage costume became the most recognized example of the elaborate concert garb with which his latterday persona became closely associated as described by bobbie ann mason at the end of the show when he spreads out his american eagle cape with the full stretched wings of the eagle studded on the back he becomes a god figure the accompanying double album released in february went to number one and eventually sold over 5 million copies in the us it was presleys last us numberone pop album during his lifetimeat a midnight show that same month four men rushed onto the stage in an apparent attack security personnel came to presleys defense and he ejected one invader from the stage himself following the show presley became obsessed with the idea that the men had been sent by mike stone to kill him though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans presley raged theres too much pain in me stone die his outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him despite administering large doses of medication after another two full days of raging red west his friend and bodyguard felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when presley decided aw hell lets just leave it for now maybe its a bit heavypresleys divorce was finalized on october 9 1973 by then his health was in serious decline twice during the year he overdosed on barbiturates spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident in late 1973 he was hospitalized from the effects of a pethidine addiction according to his primary care physician george c nichopoulos presley felt that by getting drugs from a doctor he wasnt the common everyday junkie getting something off the street since his comeback he had staged more live shows with each passing year and 1973 saw 168 concerts his busiest schedule ever despite his failing health he undertook another intensive touring schedule in 1974presleys condition declined precipitously that september keyboardist tony brown remembered his arrival at a university of maryland concert he fell out of the limousine to his knees people jumped to help and he pushed them away like dont help me he walked on stage and held onto the mic for the first thirty minutes like it was a post everybodys looking at each other like is the tour gon na happen guitarist john wilkinson recalled he was all gut he was slurring he was so fucked up it was obvious he was drugged it was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body it was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible i remember crying he could barely get through the introductionsrca began to grow anxious as his interest in the recording studio waned after a session in december 1973 that produced eighteen songs enough for almost two albums presley made no official studio recordings in 1974 parker delivered rca another concert record elvis recorded live on stage in memphis recorded on march 20 it included a version of how great thou art that won presley his third and final grammy award for best inspirational performance all three of his competitive grammy wins – out of fourteen total nominations – were for gospel recordings presley returned to the recording studio in march 1975 but parkers attempts to arrange another session toward the end of the year were unsuccessful in 1976 rca sent a mobile recording unit to graceland that made possible two fullscale recording sessions however the recording process had become a struggle for himafter presleys relationship with linda thompson ended he began dating ginger alden in november 1976 he proposed marriage to alden two months laterjournalist tony scherman wrote that by early 1977 presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek energetic former self grossly overweight his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts according to andy greene of rolling stone presleys final performances were mostly sad sloppy affairs where a bloated drugged presley struggled to remember his lyrics and get through the night without collapsing most everything from the final three years of his life is sad and hard to watch in alexandria louisiana he was on stage for less than an hour and was impossible to understand on march 31 he canceled a performance in baton rouge unable to get out of his hotel bed four shows had to be canceled and rescheduleddespite the accelerating deterioration of his health presley fulfilled most of his touring commitments according to guralnick fans were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment but it all seemed to go right past presley whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books presleys cousin billy smith recalled how he would sit in his room and chat for hours sometimes recounting favorite monty python sketches and his past escapades but more often gripped by paranoid obsessionsway down presleys last single issued during his lifetime was released on june 6 1977 that month cbs taped two concerts for a television special elvis in concert to be broadcast in october in the first shot in omaha on june 19 presleys voice guralnick writes is almost unrecognizable a small childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs casts about uncertainly for the melody in others and is virtually unable to articulate or project two days later in rapid city south dakota he looked healthier seemed to have lost a little weight and sounded better too though by the conclusion of the performance his face was framed in a helmet of blueblack hair from which sweat sheets down over pale swollen cheeks presleys final concert was held in indianapolis at market square arena on june 26 1977on august 16 1977 presley was scheduled on an evening flight out of memphis to portland maine to begin another tour that afternoon however his fiancée ginger alden discovered him unresponsive on the bathroom floor of

gracelands meditation garden on october 2while an autopsy undertaken the same day presley died was still in progress memphis medical examiner jerry francisco announced that the immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest and declared that drugs played no role in presleys death in fact drug use was heavily implicated in presleys death writes guralnick the pathologists conducting the autopsy thought it possible for instance that he had suffered anaphylactic shock brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist to which he was known to have had a mild allergy lab reports filed two months later strongly suggested that polypharmacy was the primary cause of death one reported fourteen drugs in elvis system ten in significant quantity in 1979 forensic pathologist cyril wecht reviewed the reports and concluded that a combination of depressants had resulted in presleys accidental death forensic historian and pathologist michael baden viewed the situation as complicated elvis had an enlarged heart for a long time that together with his drug habit caused his death but he was difficult to diagnose it was a judgment callthe competence and ethics of two of the centrally involved medical professionals were seriously questioned francisco had offered a cause of death before the autopsy was complete claimed the underlying ailment was cardiac arrhythmia a condition that can be determined only in a living person and denied drugs played any part in presleys death before the toxicology results were known allegations of a coverup were widespread while a 1981 trial of presleys main physician george c nichopoulos exonerated him of criminal liability the facts were startling in the first eight months of 1977 alone he had more than 10000 doses of sedatives amphetamines and narcotics all in elvis name nichopoulos license was suspended for three months it was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the tennessee medical board brought new charges of overprescriptionin 1994 the presley autopsy report was reopened joseph davis who had conducted thousands of autopsies as miamidade county coroner declared at its completion there is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs in fact everything points to a sudden violent heart attack more recent research has revealed that francisco did not speak for the entire pathology team other staff could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories if then one of the examiners e eric muirhead could not believe his ears francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospitals team of pathologists he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached early on a meticulous dissection of the body confirmed elvis was chronically ill with diabetes glaucoma and constipation as they proceeded the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs they had also studied his hospital records which included two admissions for drug detoxification and methadone treatmentsbetween 1977 and 1981 six of presleys posthumously released singles were topten country hits graceland

from gospel his mother recalled that from the age of two at the assembly of god church in tupelo attended by the family he would slide down off my lap run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform there he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them in memphis presley frequently attended allnight gospel singings at the ellis auditorium where groups such as the statesmen quartet led the music in a style that guralnick suggests sowed the seeds of presleys future stage actthe statesmen were an electric combination featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of lanskys bass singer jim wetherington known universally as the big chief maintained a steady bottom ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg then his right with the material of the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering he went about as far as you could go in gospel music said jake hess the women would jump up just like they do for the pop shows preachers frequently objected to the lewd movements but audiences reacted with screams and swoonsas a teenager presleys musical interests were wideranging and he was deeply informed about both white and africanamerican musical idioms though he never had any formal training he had a remarkable memory and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954 when jerry leiber and mike stoller met him two years later they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues and as stoller put it he certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music at a press conference the following year he proudly declared i know practically every religious song thats ever been writtenpresley played guitar bass and piano he received his first guitar when he was 11 years old he could not read or write music and had no formal lessons and played everything by ear presley often played an instrument on his recordings and produced his own music presley played rhythm acoustic guitar on most of his sun recordings and his 1950s rca victor albums presley played piano on songs such as old shep and first in line from his 1956 album elvis he is credited with playing piano on later albums such as from elvis in memphis and moody blue and on unchained melody which was one of the last songs that he recorded presley played lead guitar on one of his successful singles called are you lonesome tonight at one point during the 68 comeback special elvis took over on lead electric guitar the first time he had ever been seen with the instrument in public playing it on songs such as baby what you want me to do and one night the album elvis is back features presley playing a lot of acoustic guitar on songs such as i will be home again and like a babypresley was a central figure in the development of rockabilly according to music historians rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with elvis presleys first release on the sun label writes craig morrison paul friedlander described rockabilly as essentially an elvis presley construction with the defining elements as the raw emotive and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar country in thats all right the presley trios first record scotty moores guitar solo a combination of merle travis–style country fingerpicking doublestop slides from acoustic boogie and bluesbased bentnote singlestring work is a microcosm of this fusion while katherine charlton calls presley rockabillys originator carl perkins another pioneer of rocknroll said that phillips elvis and i didnt create rockabilly according to michael campbell the first major rockabilly song was recorded by bill haley in moores view it had been there for quite a while really carl perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around jackson and i know for a fact jerry lee lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years oldat rca victor presleys rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals more heavily amplified electric guitars and a tougher more intense manner while he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabillyrock and roll treatment he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career from the pop standard blue moon at sun records to the country ballad hows the world treating you on his second rca victor lp to the blues of santa claus is back in town in 1957 his first gospel record was released the foursong ep peace in the valley certified as a millionseller it became the topselling gospel ep in recording history presley would record gospel periodically for the rest of his lifeafter his return from military service in 1960 presley continued to perform rock and roll but the characteristic style was substantially toned down his first postarmy single the numberone hit stuck on you is typical of this shift rca victor publicity referred to its mild rock beat discographer ernst jorgensen calls it upbeat pop the number five shes not you 1962 integrates the jordanaires so completely its practically doowop the modern bluesrb sound captured with success on elvis is back was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966–67 recordings as down in the alley and hiheel sneakers presleys output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music often in the form of ballads such as are you lonesome tonight a numberone in 1960 its now or never which also topped the chart that year was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the neapolitan song o sole mio and concluding with a fullvoiced operatic cadence these were both dramatic numbers but most of what presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter veinwhile presley performed several of his classic ballads for the 68 comeback special the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll he recorded few new straight rock and roll songs thereafter as he explained they had become hard to find a significant exception was burning love his last major hit on the pop charts like his work of the 1950s presleys subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs but in markedly different permutations his stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and funk much of elvis in memphis as well as suspicious minds cut at the same sessions reflected this new rock and soul fusion in the mid1970s many of his singles found a home on country radio the field where he first became a starthe developmental arc of presleys singing voice as described by critic dave marsh goes from high and thrilled in the early days lower and perplexed in the final months marsh credits presley with the introduction of the vocal stutter on 1955s baby lets play house when on dont be cruel presley slides into a mmmmm that marks the transition between the first two verses he shows how masterful his relaxed style really is marsh describes the vocal performance on cant help falling in love as one of gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing with the line shall i stay pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystaljorgensen calls the 1966 recording of how great thou art an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions as presley crafted for himself an adhoc arrangement in which he took every part of the fourpart vocal from bass intro to the soaring heights of the songs operatic climax becoming a kind of oneman quartet guralnick finds stand by me from the same gospel sessions a beautifully articulated almost nakedly yearning performance but by contrast feels that presley reaches beyond his powers on where no one stands alone resorting to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound that jake hess of the statesmen quartet had in his command hess himself thought that while others might have voices the equal of presleys he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something the warmth of his voice his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effortmarsh praises his 1968 reading of us male bearing down on the hard guy lyrics not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his sun records the performance on in the ghetto is according to jorgensen devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms instead relying on the exceptional clarity and sensitivity of his voice guralnick describes the songs delivery as of almost translucent eloquence so quietly confident in its simplicity on suspicious minds guralnick hears essentially the same remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise but supplemented with an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism at suspected infidelity and anguish over impending lossmusic critic henry pleasants observes that presley has been described variously as a baritone and a tenor an extraordinary compass and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion he identifies presley as a high baritone calculating his range as two octaves and a third from the baritone low g to the tenor high b with an upward extension in falsetto to at least a dflat presleys best octave is in the middle dflat to dflat granting an extra full step up or down in pleasants view his voice was variable and unpredictable at the bottom often brilliant at the top with the capacity for fullvoiced high gs and as that an opera baritone might envy scholar lindsay waters who figures presleys range as twoandaquarter octaves emphasizes that his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts grunts grumbles and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender to fear his voice can not be measured in octaves but in decibels even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all presley was always able to duplicate the open hoarse ecstatic screaming shouting wailing reckless sound of the black rhythmandblues and gospel singers writes pleasants and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styleswhen dewey phillips first aired thats all right on memphis whbq many listeners who contacted the station to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black from the beginning of his national fame presley expressed respect for africanamerican performers and their music and disregard for the segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the south interviewed in 1956 he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician arthur crudup—the originator of thats all right—bang his box the way i do now and i said if i ever got to the place where i could feel all old arthur felt id be a music man like nobody ever saw the memphis world an africanamerican newspaper reported that presley cracked memphis segregation laws by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its colored night such statements and actions led presley to be generally hailed in the black community during his early stardom in contrast many white adults did not like him and condemned him as depraved antinegro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism regardless of whether parents were aware of the negro sexual origins of the phrase rock n roll presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sexdespite the largely positive view of presley held by african americans a rumor spread in mid1957 that he had announced the only thing negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes a journalist with the national african american weekly jet louie robinson pursued the story on the set of jailhouse rock presley granted robinson an interview though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press he denied making such a statement i never said anything like that and people who know me know that i wouldnt have said it a lot of people seem to think i started this business but rock n roll was here a long time before i came along nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people lets face it i cant sing like fats domino can i know that robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made and elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that presley was anything but racist blues singer ivory joe hunter who had heard the rumor before he visited graceland reported of presley he showed me every courtesy and i think hes one of the greatest though the rumored remark was discredited it was still being used against presley decades laterthe persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that presley whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to africanamerican sources achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers into the 21st century the notion that presley had stolen black music still found adherents notable among africanamerican entertainers expressly rejecting this view was jackie wilson who argued a lot of people have accused elvis of stealing the black mans music when in fact almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from elvis moreover presley acknowledged his debt to africanamerican musicians throughout his career addressing his 68 comeback special audience he said rock n roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues or it sprang from that people have been adding to it adding instruments to it experimenting with it but it all boils down to nine years earlier he had said rock n roll has been around for many years it used to be called rhythm and bluespresleys physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged he was once beautiful astonishingly beautiful according to critic mark feeney television director steve binder reported im straight as an arrow and i got to tell you you stop whether youre male or female to look at him he was that good looking and if you never knew he was a superstar it wouldnt make any difference if hed walked in the room youd know somebody special was in your presence his performance style was equally responsible for presleys eroticized image critic george melly described him as the master of the sexual simile treating his guitar as both phallus and girl in his presley obituary lester bangs credited him with bringing overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in america ed sullivans declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in presleys trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead barwhile presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality some critics have argued that his image was ambiguous in 1959 sight and sounds peter john dyer described his onscreen persona as aggressively bisexual in appeal brett farmer places the orgasmic gyrations of the title dance sequence in jailhouse rock within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a spectacular eroticization if not homoeroticization of the male image in the analysis of yvonne tasker elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised objectifying version of white workingclass masculinity as aggressive sexual displayreinforcing presleys image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with hollywood stars and starlets from natalie wood in the 1950s to connie stevens and annmargret in the 1960s to candice bergen and cybill shepherd in the 1970s june juanico of memphis one of presleys early girlfriends later blamed parker for encouraging him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind presley never grew comfortable with the hollywood scene and most of these relationships were insubstantiali know he invented rock and roll in a manner of speaking but thats not why hes worshiped as a god today hes worshiped as a god today because in addition to inventing rock and roll he was the greatest ballad singer this side of frank sinatra—because the spiritual translucence and reinedin gut sexuality of his slow weeper and torchy pop blues still activate the hormones and slavish devotion of millions of female human beings worldwide—robert christgau december 24 1985presleys rise to national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture as the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude with its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by presley—rock and rolls occupation of a central position in mainstream american culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culturein this regard little richard said of presley he was an integrator elvis was a blessing they wouldnt let black music through he opened the door for black music al green agreed he broke the ice for all of uspresident jimmy carter remarked on presleys legacy in 1977 his music and his personality fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues permanently changed the face of american popular culture presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication within a year of his first

impersonators in polls and surveys he is recognized as one of the most important popular music artists and influential americans american composer and conductor leonard bernstein said elvis presley is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century he introduced the beat to everything and he changed everything—music language clothes john lennon said that nothing really affected me until elvis bob dylan described the sensation of first hearing presley as like busting out of jailfor much of his adult life presley with his rise from poverty to riches and fame had seemed to epitomize the american dream in his final years and following the revelations about his circumstances after his death he became a symbol of excess and gluttony increasing attention was paid to his appetite for the rich heavy southern cooking of his upbringing foods such as chickenfried steak and biscuits and gravy in particular his love of fried peanut butter banana and sometimes bacon sandwiches now known as elvis sandwiches came to symbolize this characteristicsince 1977 there have been numerous alleged sightings of presley a longstanding conspiracy theory among some fans is that he faked his death adherents cite alleged discrepancies in the death certificate reports of a wax dummy in his original coffin and accounts of presley planning a diversion so he could retire in peace an unusually large number of fans have domestic shrines devoted to presley and journey to sites with which he is connected however faintly on the anniversary of his death thousands of people gather outside graceland for a candlelight ritual with elvis it is not just his music that has survived death writes ted harrison he himself has been raised like a medieval saint to a figure of cultic status it is as if he has been canonized by acclamationon the 25th anniversary of presleys death the new york times asserted all the talentless impersonators and appalling black velvet paintings on display can make him seem little more than a perverse and distant memory but before elvis was camp he was its opposite a genuine cultural force elvis breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rockandroll age his hardrocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completelyhe was ranked third on rolling stones list of greatest artists bono wrote in appreciation in elvis you have the blueprint for rock roll the highness — the gospel highs the mud — the delta mud the blues sexual liberation controversy changing the way people feel about the world its all there with elvis not only presleys achievements but
