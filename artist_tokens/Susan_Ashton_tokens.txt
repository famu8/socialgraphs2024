she reached the country music charts with youre lucky i love you which peaked at no 38 included on this album is ashtons cover of cant cry hard enough a song originally recorded by the williams brothers this album was not a commercial success when asked about this ashton responded in 2005 my perspective is that it did not turn out what i wanted it to be i wanted it to be a great country record because im from texas and i love that music but the producers i was working with—who i wholeheartedly believed wanted the best for me—loved my christian records and they were trying to emulate those a little bit im proud of those records but they arent country records song writing for this album includes kim richey matraca berg bill mann and diane warren ashton only cowrote one song closer was produced by emory gordy jr husband and producer to patty lovelessaround this time ashton and cunningham divorcedashton widened her audience even further when in 2000 she debuted on the pbs music television program austin city limits for their 25th anniversarya second album for capital was recorded but the album was shelved and has never been released although the first single she is was released ashton has stated i spent three years making a followup record for capitol and then early last year they dropped me from the label so ive spent the last year being a nanny sitting waiting and hearing what god wants me to do with my life it was really difficult but at the same time ive i needed some healing and clarity this past year has been really emotional and ultimately turned out really good i think i was probably aware that i was going to lose my deal but its a whole different story knowing youre going to lose it and then actually having it be gone this interview came after years of silence from ashtonin 2005 ashton released a second trio album originally released only in australia and europe as kisses from heaven the album was eventually released in the united states as lost in wonder voices of worship this album was recorded with michelle tumes and christine denté the album was conceived in 2003 when asked how the project came about ashton replied about two years ago i became friends with john hartley before i lost my record deal i was asked to sing some demos for what would become a worship project releasing in england when i lost my deal john asked if i would still be interested in continuing with the project god had been healing me growing me and helping me find my center again and this seemed to fit as part of his plan ashton did not record the vocals in person with denté and tumes the three were only together for the covers photo shootin 2006 sparrow records released susan ashton the ultimate collection a twocd set of previously released
