called love you backthe band members have always said that the bands name was chosen arbitrarily complaining about the difficulty of choosing a name inspired by the country style nostalgia of a photo shoot at a mansion from the antebellum south they said one of us said the word and we all kind of stopped and said man that could be a name and man thats a beautiful antebellum house and thats cool maybe theres a haunted ghost or something in there like lady antebellum haywood concluded had a lady in the group obviously and threw lady in the front of it for no reason i wish we had a great resounding story to remember for the name but it stuck ever since the name was always controversial with a critic in ms magazine writing in 2011 that the bands name seems to me an example of the way we still — nearly 150 years after the end of the civil war nearly 50 years after the civil rights act and in a supposedly postracial country led by a biracial president — glorify a culture that was based on the violent oppression of people of coloron june 11 2020 joining widespread commercial response to the george floyd protests the band announced it would abbreviate its name to its existing nickname lady a to remove the term antebellum the band members stated on social media that never having previously sought the dictionary definition of the word antebellum they now consulted their closest black friends and colleagues so that their eyes opened wide to the injustices inequality and biases black women and men have always faced and continue to face every day now blind spots we didnt even know existed have been revealed fan response was mixed with many decrying virtue signaling or even disparaging the protests american songwriter said given that the world knows what that a stands for to many this change does little more than add extra insult to this ongoing injurythe next day it was widely reported that the name lady a had already been in use for more than 20 years by seattlebased african american activist and blues soul funk and gospel singer anita white the band again admitted ignorance of any prior use which white called pure privilege interviewed by rolling stone white described the bands token acknowledgement of racism while blithely appropriating an african american artists name theyre using the name because of a black lives matter incident that for them is just a moment in time if it mattered it would have mattered to them before it shouldnt have taken george floyd to die for them to realize that their name had a slave reference to it its an opportunity for them to pretend theyre not racist a veteran music industry lawyer observed that such name clashes are uncommon due to the existence of the internet the band members contacted white the next week to apologize for having inadvertently coopted and dominated her name saying that the black lives matter movement had inspired them to a collaborative attitude they nonetheless required retaining the same name though she believed dualnaming is inherently impossible she said we talked about attempting to coexist but didnt discuss what that would look like because the band members would not directly respond to that explicit question three times during the conversation or in two contract drafts she soon submitted a counteroffer that either the band would be renamed or that her act would be renamed for a 5 million fee plus a 5 million donation to be split between seattle charities a nationwide legal defense fund for independent artists and black lives matteron july 8 2020 the band filed a lawsuit against white asking a nashville court to affirm its longstanding trademark of the name the press release read today we are sad to share that our sincere hope to join together with anita white in unity and common purpose has ended she and her team have demanded a 10 million payment so reluctantly we have come to the conclusion that we need to ask a court to affirm our right to continue to use the name lady a a trademark we have held for many yearson september 15 2020 white filed a countersuit asserting her claim to the lady a trademark and rejecting the notion that both artists could operate in the same industry under the same brand identity she is seeking damages for lost sales and a weakened brand along with royalties from any income the band receives under the lady a monikerin october 2021 musician lilli lewiss album americana was temporarily blocked and held for review by the streamingservice spotify because one of the songs on the album a healing inside credited white as lady a the album was returned to the streaming within a week of lewis becoming aware of the situationin february 2022 pitchfork reported that white and the band had settled their lawsuit the parties filed a joint request for dismissal to a judge in a federal tennessee court and the terms of the settlement have not been disclosedsince january 2012 lady a has been partnered with the charity mylifespeaks to raise awareness of and provide facilities for disabled orphans in haiti at the start of the year 2013 the members of the group also created the fund called ladyaid which
