acquaintance of wild bill hickok late in her life she appeared in buffalo bills wild west show and at the 1901 panamerican exposition she is said to have exhibited compassion to others especially to the sick and needy this facet of her character contrasted with her daredevil ways and helped to make her a noted frontier figure she was also known for her habit of wearing mens attiremuch of the information about the early years of calamity janes life comes from an autobiographical booklet that she dictated in 1896 written for publicity purposes it was intended to help attract audiences to a tour she was about to begin in which she appeared in dime museums around the united states some of the information in the pamphlet is exaggerated or even completely inaccuratecalamity jane was born on may 1 1852 as martha jane canary or cannary in princeton within mercer county missouri her parents were listed in the 1860 census as living about 7 miles 11 km northeast of princeton in ravanna her father robert wilson canary had a gambling problem and little is known about her mother charlotte m canary jane was the eldest of six children with two brothers and three sistersin 1865 the family moved by wagon train from missouri to virginia city montana in 1866 charlotte died of pneumonia along the way in blackfoot montana after arriving in virginia city in the spring of 1866 robert took his six children to salt lake city utah they arrived in the summer and robert supposedly started farming on 40 acres 16 ha of land the family had been in salt lake city for only a year when he died in 1867 at age 14 martha jane took charge of her five younger siblings loaded their wagon and took the family to fort bridger wyoming territory where they arrived in may 1868 from there they traveled on the union pacific railroad to piedmont wyomingin piedmont jane took whatever jobs she could find to provide for her large family she worked as a dishwasher cook waitress dance hall girl nurse and ox team driver finally in 1874 she claimed she found work as a scout at fort russell during this time she also reportedly began her occasional employment as a prostitute at the fort laramie threemile hog ranch she moved to a rougher mostly outdoor and adventurous life on the great plainsjane was involved in several campaigns in the longrunning military conflicts with native americans her claim was thatit was during this campaign that i was christened calamity jane it was on goose creek wyoming where the town of sheridan is now located capt egan was in command of the post we were ordered out to quell an uprising of the indians and were out for several days had numerous skirmishes during which six of the soldiers were killed and several severely wounded when on returning to the post we were ambushed about a mile and a half from our destination when fired upon capt egan was shot i was riding in advance and on hearing the firing turned in my saddle and saw the captain reeling in his saddle as though about to fall i turned my horse and galloped back with all haste to his side and got there in time to catch him as he was falling i lifted him onto my horse in front of me and succeeded in getting him safely to the fort capt egan on recovering laughingly said i name you calamity jane the heroine of the plains i have borne that name up to the present timecaptain jack crawford served under generals wesley merritt and george crook according to the montana anaconda standard of april 19 1904 he stated that calamity jane never saw service in any capacity under either general crook or general miles she never saw a lynching and never was in an indian fight she was simply a notorious character dissolute and devilish but possessed a generous streak which made her populara popular belief is that she instead acquired the nickname as a result of her warnings to men that to offend her was to court calamity it is possible that jane was not part of her name until the nickname was coined for her it is certain however that she was known by that nickname by 1876 because the arrival of the hickok wagon train was reported in deadwoods newspaper the black hills pioneer on july 15 1876 with the headline calamity jane has arrivedanother account in her autobiographical pamphlet is that her detachment was ordered to the big horn river under general crook in 1875 she swam the platte river and travelled 90 miles 140 km at top speed while wet and cold in order to deliver important dispatches she became ill afterwards and spent a few weeks recuperating she then rode to fort laramie in wyoming and joined a wagon train headed north in july 1876 the second part of her story is verified she was at fort laramie in july 1876 and she did join a wagon train that included wild bill hickok that was where she first met hickok contrary to her later claims and that was how she happened to come to deadwoodcalamity jane accompanied the newton–jenney party into rapid city in 1875

offspring of martha jane canary and james butler hickok she presented evidence that calamity jane and wild bill had married at bensons landing montana territory now livingston montana on september 25 1873 the documentation was written in a bible and presumably signed by two ministers and numerous witnesses however mccormicks claim has been vigorously challenged because of a variety of discrepanciesmccormick later published a book with letters purported to be from calamity jane to her daughter in them calamity jane says she had been married to hickok and that hickok was the father of mccormick who was born september 25 1873 and was placed for adoption with a captain jim oneil and his wife during this period calamity jane was allegedly working as a scout for the army and at the

deadwood with a child who she said was her daughter at janes request a benefit was held in one of the theaters to raise money for her daughters education in st martins academy at sturgis south dakota a nearby catholic boarding school the benefit raised a large sum jane got drunk and spent a considerable portion of the money that same night and left with the child the next dayestelline bennett was living in deadwood at that time and had spoken briefly with jane a few days before the benefit she thought that jane honestly wanted her daughter to have an education and that the drunken binge was just an example of her inability to curb her impulses and carry through longrange plans which bennett saw as typical of janes class bennett later heard that janes daughter did get an education and grew up and married welljane also claimed that following hickoks death she went after his murderer jack mccall with a meat cleaver because she had left her guns at her residence following mccalls execution for the crime jane continued living in the deadwood area for some time and at one point she helped save numerous passengers in an overland stagecoach by diverting several plains indians who
