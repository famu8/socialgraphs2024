the attention of a few labels including mercury nashville records who signed her within a few months during this time she changed her name to shania which was rumoured to be an ojibwa word which means on my way however her biographer robin eggar writes there is a continuing confusion about what shania means and if indeed it is an ojibwe word or phrase at all there is no mispronounced or misheard phrase in either ojibwe or cree that comes close to meaning on my way yet the legend of her name continues to be repeated in the media to this day eggar was mistaken about there being no ojibwe phrase that comes close as ani ayaaa pronounced ahnih eyeuhah means someone on the way in ojibwe it is therefore possible that someone with an imperfect knowledge of the ojibwe language created shania with
