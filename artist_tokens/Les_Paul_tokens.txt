as red hot red and rhubarb redat the age of eight paul began playing the harmonica after learning the piano he switched to the banjo and guitar during this time paul invented a neckworn harmonica holder which allowed him to play both sides of the harmonica handsfree while performing on the banjo and guitar les pauls handsfree design is still widely manufactured today by age thirteen paul was performing semiprofessionally as a countrymusic singer guitarist and harmonica player while playing at waukesha area driveins and roadhouses paul began his first experiment with sound wanting to make his acoustic guitar heard by more people at the local venues he wired a phonograph needle to his guitar and connected it to a radio speaker as a teen paul experimented with sustain by using a 2foot piece of rail from a nearby train line at age seventeen paul played with rube tronsons texas cowboys and soon after he dropped out of high school to team up with sunny joe wolvertons radio band in st louis missouri on kmoxpaul and wolverton moved to chicago in 1934 where they continued to perform country music on radio station wbbm and at the 1934 chicago worlds fair while in chicago paul learned jazz from the great performers on chicagos southside during the day he played country music as rhubarb red on the radio at night he was les paul playing jazz he met pianist art tatum whose playing influenced him to continue with the guitar rather than play jazz on the piano his first two records were released in 1936 credited to rhubarb red pauls hillbilly alter ego he also served as an accompanist for other bands signed to decca during this time he began adding different sounds and adopted his stage name of les paulpauls guitar style was strongly influenced by the music of django reinhardt whom he greatly admired following world war ii paul sought out and made friends with reinhardt when reinhardt died in 1953 paul paid for part of the funerals cost one of pauls prized possessions was a selmer acoustic guitar given to him by reinhardts widowpaul formed a trio in 1937 with rhythm guitarist jim atkins older halfbrother of guitarist chet atkins and bassistpercussionist ernie darius newton they left chicago for new york in 1938 landing a featured spot with fred warings radio show chet atkins later wrote that his brother home on a family visit presented him with an expensive gibson archtop guitar that les paul had given to jim chet recalled that it was the first professionalquality instrument he ever ownedwhile jamming in his apartment basement in 1941 paul nearly succumbed to electrocution during two years of recuperation he moved to chicago where he was the music director for radio stations wjjd and wind in 1943 he moved to hollywood where he performed on radio and formed a new triohe was drafted into the us army in 1943 where he served in the armed forces radio network backing such artists as bing crosby and the andrews sisters and performing in his own rightas a lastminute replacement for oscar moore paul played with nat king cole and other artists in the inaugural jazz at the philharmonic concert in los angeles california on july 2 1944 his solo on body and soul is a demonstration of his admiration for and emulation of django reinhardt as well as his development of original linesalso that year pauls trio appeared on bing crosbys radio show crosby sponsored pauls recordings they recorded together several times including its been a long long time which was a no 1 hit in 1945 paul recorded several albums for decca in the 1940s the andrews sisters hired his trio to open for them during a tour in 1946 their manager lou levy said watching pauls fingers while he played guitar was like watching a train go by their conductor vic schoen said his playing was always original maxine andrews said hed tune into the passages we were singing and lightly play the melody sometimes in harmony wed sing these fancy licks and hed keep up with us note for note in exactly the same rhythm almost contributing a fourth voice but he never once took the attention away from what we were doing he did everything he could to make us sound better in the 1950s when he recorded mary fords vocals on multiple tracks he created music that sounded like the andrews sistersin january 1948 paul shattered his right arm and elbow among multiple injuries in a nearfatal automobile accident on an icy route 66 west of davenport oklahoma mary ford was driving the buick convertible which plunged off the side of a railroad overpass and dropped twenty feet into a ravine they were returning from wisconsin to los angeles after visiting family doctors at oklahoma citys wesley hospital told paul that they could not rebuild his elbow their other option was amputation paul was flown to los angeles where his arm was set at an angle—just over 90 degrees—that allowed him to cradle and pick the guitar it took him nearly a year and a half to recoverin 1940 les paul revisited his experiments with the train rail this time he created a similar prototype instrument a oneoff solidbody electric guitar known as the log which was manufactured utilizing a common construction material often referred to as a “ 4×4 stud post ” which provided a unique neckthru design the “ stud post ” a 4″ × 4″ section of douglas fir was then equipped with a crude bridge and an electromagnetic pickup neck and strings the log was constructed by paul afterhours in the new york city epiphone guitar factory and is one of the first solidbody electric guitars for the sake of appearance he attached the body of an epiphone hollowbody guitar sawn lengthwise with the log in the middle this solved his two main problems feedback as the acoustic body no longer resonated with the amplified sound and sustain as the energy of the strings was not dissipated in generating sound through the guitar body these instruments were constantly being improved and modified over the years and paul continued to use them in his recordings even after the development of his eponymous gibson modelpaul approached the gibson guitar corporation with his idea of a solidbody electric guitar in 1941 but gibson showed no interest until fender began marketing its esquire and broadcaster guitars in 1950 the broadcaster was renamed the telecaster in 1952gibsons ted mccarty was the chief designer of the guitar which was based on pauls drawings and later dubbed the gibson les paul gibson entered into a promotional and financial arrangement with les paul paying him a royalty on sales the guitar went on sale in 1952 paul continued to make design suggestionsin 1960 sales of the original les paul model had dropped so a more modernistic model was introduced today called the sg but then still bearing the les paul name not liking the new look and severe problems with the strength of the body and neck made paul dissatisfied with this new gibson guitar this and a pending divorce from mary ford led to paul ending his endorsement and use of his name on gibson guitars from 1964 until 1966 by which time his divorce was completedpaul continued to suggest technical improvements although they were not always successful commercially in 1962 paul was issued us patent 3018680 for a pickup in which the coil was integrated into the bridge in the mid1940s he introduced an aluminum guitar with the tuning mechanisms below the bridge as it had no headstock and the string attachments were at the nut it was the first headless guitar unfortunately pauls guitar was so sensitive to the heat from stage lights that it would not keep tune however he used it for several of his hit recordings this style was further developed by others most successfully ned steinbergera lessexpensive version of the les paul guitar is manufactured for gibsons epiphone brandpaul first experimented with sound on sound while in elementary school when he punched holes in the piano roll for his mothers player piano in 1946 his mother complimented him on a song she had heard on the radio when in fact she had heard george barnes not paul this motivated paul to spend two years in his hollywood garage recording studio creating his unique sound his new sound paul stunned the music industry with his new sound in 1948paul recorded several songs with bing crosby most notably its been a long long time which was a numberone single in 1945after a recording session bing crosby suggested that paul build a recording studio so he could produce the sound he wanted paul started his studio in the garage of his home on north curson street in hollywood the studio drew many vocalists and musicians who wanted the benefit of his expertise his experiments included microphone placement track speed and recording overdubs these methods resulted in a clarity previously unheard in this type of multitrack recording people began to consider his recording techniques as instruments—as important to production as a guitar bass or drumscapitol records released lover when youre near me on which paul played eight different parts on electric guitar some recorded at halfspeed hence doublefast when played back at normal speed for the master this was the first time he used multitracking in a recording his early multitrack recordings including lover and brazil were made with acetate discs he recorded a track onto a disk then recorded himself playing another part with the first he built the multitrack recording with overlaid tracks rather than parallel ones as he did later by the time he had a result that satisfied him he had discarded some five hundred recording disksas a teen he had built a disccutter assembly using the flywheel from a cadillac a dental belt and other parts from his fathers car repair shop years later in his hollywood garage he used the acetate disc setup to record parts at different speeds and with delay resulting in his signature sound with echoes and birdsonglike guitar riffsin 1949 crosby gave paul one of the first ampex model 200a reel to reel tape recorders paul invented sound on sound recording using this machine by placing an additional playback head located before the conventional eraserecordplayback heads this allowed paul to play along with a previously recorded track both of which were mixed together onto a new track the ampex was a monophonic tape recorder with only one track across the entire width of quarterinch tape and therefore the recording was destructive in the sense that the original recording was permanently replaced with the new mixed recording he eventually enhanced this by using one tape machine to play back the original recording and a second to record the combined track this preserved the original recordingin 1952 paul invented the flange effect wherein two recordings of the same sound run slightly asynchronously causing phase cancellations that sweep through the frequency range the first example of this can be heard on his song mammys boogieobserving film recordings inspired paul to design the stacking of eight tape recorders he worked with ross snyder on the design of the first eighttrack recording deck built for him by ampex for his home studio rein narma built a custom 8channel mixing console for him the mixing board included inline equalization and vibrato effects he named the recorder the octopus and the mixing console the monster the name octopus was inspired by comedian w c fields who was the first person to hear paul play his multitracked guitar experiments he came to my garage to make a little record in 1946 les recalled i played him the acetate of lover that id done when he heard it he said my boy you sound like an octopusin the summer of 1945 paul met countrywestern singer iris colleen summers they began working together on pauls radio show as rhubarb red and the ozark apple knockers with mary lou later paul suggested the stage name mary ford they married in milwaukee in 1949their hits included how high the moon bye bye blues song in blue doncha hear them bells the world is waiting for the sunrise and vaya con dios the songs were recorded with multiple tracks where ford harmonized with herself and paul played multiple layers of guitarsthey used the recording technique known as close miking where the microphone is less than 6 inches 15 cm from the singers mouth this produces a more intimate less reverberant sound than when a singer is 1 foot 30 cm or more from the microphone when using a pressuregradient uni or bidirectional microphone it emphasizes lowfrequency sounds in the voice due to the microphones proximity effect and gives a more relaxed feel because the performer is not working as hard the result is a singing style which diverged from the unamplified theater style of the musical comedies of the 1930s and 1940sthey also performed musichall style semicomic routines with mary mimicking whatever line les decided to improvisepaul hosted a 15minute radio program the les paul show on nbc radio in 1950 featuring his trio himself ford and rhythm player eddie stapleton and his electronics the program was recorded from their home and with gentle humor between paul and ford bridging musical selections some of which had already been successful on records some of which anticipated the couples recordings and many of which presented reinterpretations of such jazz and pop selections as in the mood little rock getaway brazil and tiger rag many of these shows survive and are available from various sourceswhen paul used magnetic tape he could take his recording equipment on tour making episodes for his fifteenminute radio show in a hotel roomthe show appeared on television a few years later with the same format but excluding the trio and retitled les paul mary ford at home with vaya con dios as the theme song sponsored by warner–lamberts listerine mouthwash it was aired on nbc television during 1954–1955 and then was syndicated until 1960 the fiveminute show consisting of the performance of only one or two songs aired five times a day five days a week and therefore was used as a brief interlude or fillin for programming schedules since paul created the entire show himself including audio and video he maintained the original recordings and was in the process of restoring them to current quality standards until his deathduring his radio shows paul introduced the fictional les paulverizer device which multiplies anything fed into it such as a guitar sound or a voice it was pauls way of explaining how his single guitar could be multiplied to become a group of guitars the device even became the subject of comedy with ford multiplying herself and her vacuum cleaner with it so she could finish the housework faster later paul created a real les paulverizer that he attached to his guitar the invention allowed paul to access prerecorded layers of songs during live performances so he could replicate his recorded sound on stagein 1965 paul went into semiretirement although he did return to his studio occasionally he and ford had divorced at the end of 1964 after she became tired of touring one of pauls most recognizable recordings from then through the mid1970s was an album for london recordsphase 4 stereo les paul now 1968 on which he updated some of his earlier hits paul played the initial guitar track and george barnes laid down the additional tracks while paul engineered in his home studio he also recorded two albums chester and lester 1976 and guitar monsters 1978 for rca victor comprising a meld of jazz and country improvisation with guitar virtuoso chet atkins backed by some of nashvilles celebrated studio musiciansin 1969 paul produced the album poe through the glass prism for rca the album featured songs based on edgar allan poes writing by the northeastern pennsylvania band the glass prism the album produced a single titled the raven that appeared on billboards hot 100as years
