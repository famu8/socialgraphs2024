sisters have cited bonnie raitt emmylou harris and linda ronstadt as their primary musical influences thomas goldsmith of the tennessean wrote that kims alto voice is key to the groups densely textured sound he also noted between their first two singles the unusual subject matter of when youre in love about a woman who threatens reprisal for an unfaithful husband as well as the carousel keyboards and ringing guitars of i fell in love again last night a review of perfume ribbons pearls published in people compared kathy and kims voices favorably to terri gibbs james m tarbox of knight ridder news services described the sisters voices as having a coquetteish playfulness they keep under enough control that it neither becomes cloying nor prevents them from offering something as thoughtful as the hit too many riversthe forester sisters were frequently compared to other family music groups of the time including the judds and the whites an uncredited review from people called the sisters the cheeriest bunch of good old gals since the mandrells barbara mandrell louise mandrell and irlene mandrell and noted that unlike the whites the forester sisters did not have a male vocalist to more depth and richness to the family harmonies the sisters concerts were reportedly more heavily attended by women than men an observation made by both billboard and the tennessean
