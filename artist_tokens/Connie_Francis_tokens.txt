accordion playerfrancis attended newark arts high school in 1951 and 1952 she and her family moved to belleville new jersey where francis graduated as salutatorian from belleville high school class of

name she appeared on nbcs variety show startime kids between 1953 and 1955during rehearsals for her appearance on arthur godfreys talent scouts in december 1950 francis was advised by godfrey to change her stage name to connie francis for easier pronunciation godfrey also told her to drop the accordion—advice she gladly followed as she had begun to hate the large and heavy instrument around the same time francis took a job as a singer on demonstration records to bring unreleased songs to the attention of established singers andor their management who might choose to record them for a professional commercial recordin 1955 startime kids went off the air in may that same year george franconero sr and franciss manager george scheck raised money for a recording session of four songs which they hoped to sell to a major record company under franciss own name even when mgm records decided to sign a contract with her it was because one track she had recorded freddy happened to be the name of the son of a company executive harry a meyerson who thought of the song as a nice birthday gift hence freddy was released as franciss first single which turned out to be a commercial failure just like her next eight solo singlesdespite these failures francis was hired to record the vocals for tuesday welds singing scenes in the 1956 movie rock rock rock and for freda holloway in the 1957 warner brothers rock and roll movie jamboreein the fall of 1957 francis enjoyed her first modest success with a duet single she had recorded with marvin rainwater the majesty of love with you my darlin you as the bside peaked at number 93 on the billboard hot 100 eventually the single sold over one million copieshowever her minor chart success came too late for her record label—franciss recording contract consisted of ten solo singles and one duet single though success had finally seemed to come with the majesty of love francis was informed by mgm records that her contract would not be renewed after her last solo singlefrancis considered a career in medicine and was about to accept a fouryear scholarship offered at new york university at what was to have been her final recording session for mgm on october 2 1957 with joe lipman and his orchestra she recorded a cover version of the 1923 song whos sorry now written by bert kalmar and harry ruby francis has said that she recorded it at the insistence of her father who was convinced it stood a chance of becoming a hit because it was a song adults already knew and that teenagers would dance to if it had a contemporary arrangementfrancis did not like the song and argued about it with her father heatedly delaying the recording of the two other songs during the session so much that she thought no time was left on the continuously running recording tape her father insisted though and when the recording whos sorry now was finished only a few seconds remained on the tapethe single seemed to go unnoticed like all previous releases just as francis had predicted but on january 1 1958 it debuted on dick clarks american bandstand francis watched the show and wrote in her diaryi heard dick clark mention something about a new girl singer so what else is new another girl singer there are ninetyfive million females in the country and ill bet ninetyfive percent of them sing theres no doubt about it predicted mr clark shes is headed straight for the number one spot i began feeling sorry for myself and a bit envious too good luck to her i thought and then mr clark just happened to play a song called whos sorry now my whos sorry now well the feeling was cosmic just cosmic right there in my livingroom it became mardi grastime and new years eve at the turn of the centuryand on february 15 of that same year francis performed it on the first episode of the saturday night beechnut show also hosted by clark by midyear over a million copies had been sold and francis was suddenly launched into worldwide stardom in april 1958 whos sorry now reached number 1 on the uk singles chart and number 4 in the us for the next four years francis was voted the best female vocalist by american bandstand viewersas connie francis explains at each of her concerts she began searching for a new hit immediately after the success of whos sorry now since mgm records had renewed her contract after the relative failure of the followup singles im sorry i made you cry which stalled at no 36 and heartaches failing to chart at all francis met neil sedaka and howard greenfield who sang a number of ballads they had written for her after a few hours francis began writing in her diary while the songwriters played the last of their ballads this and her refusal to let sedaka and greenfield see the diary to mine it for material inspired the duo to write sedakas own breakthrough hit the diary afterwards francis told them that she considered their ballads too intellectual and sophisticated for the young generation and requested a more lively song greenfield urged sedaka to sing a song they had written that morning with the shepherd sisters in mind sedaka protested that francis would be insulted but greenfield said that since she hated all the other songs they had performed they had nothing to lose sedaka then played stupid cupid when he finished francis announced that he had just played her new hit song it went on to reach number 14 on the billboard chart and was her second number 1 in the ukthe success of stupid cupid restored momentum to francis chart career and she reached the us top 40 an additional eight times during the remainder of the 1950s she managed to churn out more hits by covering several older songs such as my happiness number 2 on the hot 100 and among my souvenirs number 7 as well as

first motion picture the movie introduced the concept of spring break as the once sleepy town of fort lauderdale became the hotspot for college students on their spring vacation in the wake of the

followed by other major british and american recording stars including wanda jackson cliff richard petula clark brenda lee the supremes peggy march pat boone lesley gore the beatles and johnny cash
