options to change the sounds that you are putting down and those are for the most part not good choices to have for an artist and mechanics are always going to provide inherent little flaws and tiny little specks and hisses that will add to the idea of something beautiful something romantic perfection making things perfectly in time and perfectly free of extraneous noise is not something to aspire to why would anyone aspire to such a thing—jack whitewhite has long been a proponent of analog equipment and the associated working methods beginning in the fifth grade he and his childhood friend dominic suchyta would listen to records in whites attic on weekends and began to record cover songs on an old fourtrack reeltoreel tape machine the white stripes first album was largely recorded in the attic of his parents home as their fame grew beyond detroit the stripes became known for their affected innocence and strippeddown playing style in particular white became distinguished for his nasal vocal delivery and loose explosive guitar delivery in an early new york times concert review from 2001 ann powers said that while whites playing was ingenious he created more challenges by playing an acoustic guitar with paper taped over the hole and a lessthanhighquality solid body electrichis home studio in nashville contains two rooms i want everyone close focused

showmanship and affectations since the beginning critics have debated the riddle of whites selfawareness against his claims of authenticity with people falling on both sides of the issue joe hagan of the new york times asked in 2001 is mr white a 25yearold former upholsterer from southwest detroit concocting this stuff with a wink or are the white stripes simply naïve alexis petridis of the guardian said that white makes for an enigmatic figure not because hes particularly difficult or guarded but simply because what he tells you suggests a lifelong penchant for inscrutable behavior white himself confesses sometimes i think im a simple guy but i think the reality is im really complicated as simple as i wish i waswhite has been called eccentric he is known for creating a mythology around his endeavors examples include his claim that the stripes began on bastille day that he and meg are the two youngest of ten siblings and that third man records used to be a candy factory these assertions came into question or were disproven as when in 2002 the detroit free press produced copies of both a marriage license and divorce certificate for him and meg confirming their history as a married couple neither addresses the truth officially and jack continues to refer to meg as his sister in interviews including in the documentary under great white northern lights filmed in 2007 in a 2005 interview with rolling stone magazine jack alluded to this open secret implying that it was intended to keep the focus on the music rather than the couples relationship when you see a band that is two pieces husband and wife boyfriend and girlfriend you think oh i see when theyre brother and sister you go oh thats interesting you care more about the music not the relationship—whether theyre trying to save their relationship by being in a bandit became hypnotic this was the minimum amount of staples i could put to hold this fabric down the number three exemplifies the almost iconic mysterious perfection that can not be obtained to this day i still think about it all the time white on how seeing three staples on an upholstery piece triggered his affinity for the number threehe has an attachment to the number three stemming from seeing three staples in the back of a vladimir kagan couch he helped to upholster as an apprentice his business ventures frequently feature three in the title and he typically appends iii to the end of his name during the white stripes 2005 tour in the uk white began referring to himself as three quid—quid being british slang for pound sterlinghe maintains an aesthetic that he says challenges whether people will believe he is real he frequently colorcodes his endeavors such as the aforementioned third man upholstery and the white stripes as well as third man records which is completely outfitted in yellow black red and blue including staff uniforms as a taxidermy enthusiast—that correlates to his work as an upholsterer—he decorates his studio in preserved animals including a peacock giraffe and himalayan goatwhite is protective of his privacy and gives few details of his family life even going as far as to disseminate false information he states that he does not consider his personal life relevant to his art saying its the same thing as asking michelangelo what kind of shoes do you wear in the end it doesnt really matter the only thing thats going to be left is our records and photoshis collection of esoterica include lead bellys new york city arrest record james browns georgia drivers license from the 1980s and a copy of the first superman comic from june 1938 for 300000 in january 2015 an online bidder won an auction for elvis presleys first recording ever—an acetate of the two cover songs my happiness and
