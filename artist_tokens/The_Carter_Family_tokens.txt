as the familys repertoire of songs was maybelles guitar playing she developed her innovative guitar technique largely in isolation her style is today widely known as the carter scratch or carter family picking while maybelle did use a flatpick on occasion her major method of guitar playing was the use of her thumb with a thumbpick along with one or two fingers what her guitar style accomplished was to allow her to play melody lines on the low strings of the guitar while still maintaining rhythm using her fingers brushing across the higher stringsbefore the carter familys recordings the guitar was rarely used as a lead or solo instrument among musicians maybelles interweaving of a melodic line on the bass strings with intermittent strums is now a staple of steel string guitar technique flatpickers such as doc watson clarence white and norman blake took flatpicking to a higher technical level but all acknowledge maybelles playing as their inspirationit has been noted that by the end of the twenties maybelle carter scratch was the most widely imitated guitar style in music nobody did as much to popularize the guitar because from the beginning her playing was distinctive as any voicethe carter family was elected to the country music hall of fame in 1970 and were given the nickname the first family of country musicin 1988 the carter family was inducted into
