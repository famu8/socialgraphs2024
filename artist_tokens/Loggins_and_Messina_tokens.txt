wed talk about it but i was having too much fun as a solo artist loggins said that summer it was very rewarding for me and i wasnt ready to share the reins i still had a lot of stuff to do on my own to prove myself and to express myself in a way that wouldnt have fit in with loggins and messinathe two were pleased enough to consider future loggins and messina projects and the two also toured in 2009 like most relationships we were a moment in time loggins said its just really fun to be able to go back and celebrate that and just sort of really honor each other as grown men in a way we never really did back then we were young and competitive and didnt realize that it wasnt necessarily all about getting your way but you learn that if you grow uptheir backing band changed from album to
