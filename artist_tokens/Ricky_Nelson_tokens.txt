concert at madison square garden where the audience booed perhaps against some unrelated police action however nelson may have felt that the reason was because he was playing new songs instead of just his old hits when he performed the rolling stones honky tonk women there was booing said to be against police and not him he was watching the rest of the performance on a tv monitor backstage until richard nader finally convinced nelson to return to the stage and play his oldies he returned to the stage and played his oldies and the audience responded with applause according to deborah nader president of richard nader entertainment he wanted to record an album featuring original material but the single was released before the album because nelson had not completed the entire garden party
