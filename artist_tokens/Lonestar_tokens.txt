its predecessors jeffrey b remz was less favorable writing in country standard time that everything tends to have the same typical anthemic feel making it all sound so radio readycoming home followed in 2005 for this album mcdonald noted that huff had told the band that he didnt want to produce us anymore so mcdonald began searching for a new producer in doing so he purchased fifteen different

dull set of songs of happy homes michael sudhalter of country standard time noted the presence of ballads comparable to the preceding albums but also felt that most of the other content was comparable to the bands debut albumin early 2006 sara evans released the single coalmine from her album real fine place which mcdonald cowrote with roxie dean and ron harbin at a december 2006 concert in corpus christi texas mcdonald was unavailable while recovering from back surgery so josh gracin sang lead vocals in his absencemountains was the bands final album for bna released in late 2006 it was

followup nothing to prove peaked at 51 erlewine criticized the band for taking fewer risks than ever on the album billboard writer ken tucker praised the album for containing positive messages in the singles while also noting the use of vocal harmony and countryrock instrumentation jeff lincoln of country standard time criticized some of the songs for overly sensitive lyrics but felt that always in the band a song about a singer attempting to balance his career and family life was personalin march 2007 lonestar was dropped from bnas roster due to declining sales guitarist michael britt attributes the groups commercial downfall in the mid2000s to the labels choices in singles saying in an interview with cmt i think we painted ourselves into a corner they started putting out a bunch of familytype songs i think that really pigeonholed us the majority of the band didnt really want to continue doing that same thing but thats what kept getting put out mcdonald also announced that he would be leaving the group at the end of 2007 to begin a solo career cody collins who had previously been the lead singer of the band mcalyster in 2000 was confirmed as his replacement lonestars first release with collins as lead singer was the 2007 christmas music compilation titled my christmas list available exclusively at the restaurant and gift shop chain cracker barrel dan macintosh of country standard time reviewed this album favorably calling collins voice a comfortable fit while also praising the variety of arrangements given to traditional christmas carols on the albummcdonald also released a christmas album in late 2007 titled if every day could be christmas it was followed a year later by i turn to you a contemporary christian music album released via stroudavarious records later known as rj records after this album he had two chart singles in 2009 both peaking at number 51 how do i just stop and six foot teddy bear the former appeared on his third solo album slow down which was released via loremoma in 2010the groups first single to feature collins on lead vocals was let me love you which was released in early 2008 on saguaro road records it is the first single from the album party heard around the world released on april 27 2010 and produced by the band itself a review in country standard time criticized collins vocals as being too similar to those of keith urban while also saying that it had lot of songs about love life and relationships the usual clichés you find in todays popcountry erlewine found little difference in the bands sound following the change to collins saying that theyre still gunning for a wide audience because commercialism simply is in their bones the lonestar name means nothing if the band isnt big slick and crowdpleasingcollins left in 2011 and mcdonald returned to the group to honor both his rejoining and the bands 20th anniversary they began an international tour in 2012 their first single after his rejoining was the countdown released via 4 star records it peaked at number 52 on the country charts in late 2012 the song is included on an album titled life as we know it released on june 4 2013 erlewine was mixed toward the albums content writing in allmusic that it was filled with bright shiny songs about romanceinfused with a genial fondness for everything that comes their wayall this sounds sweet enough in theory but in execution the calculation is a bit too apparent henry l carrigan jr of country standard time wrote that it is all about singing it loud with one song barely distinguishable from another musically or thematicallyin 2014 duo haley michaels released just another love song which they wrote with mcdonald the song contains lyrical references to amazed and features mcdonald singing its chorus never enders lonestars tenth album came out in 2016 the albums lead single and title track was delivered to country radio on march 17 never enders was released and distributed through shanachie entertainment on april 29 erlewine was more positive toward this album than its predecessors noting that the songs may not be grabbers but theyre sturdy melodic constructions given a lift by an enveloping polished production that effectively softens the rougher edges of mcdonalds voice hes hardly gravelly but he is nicely weathered the album received a mixed review from lincoln who found some of the songwriting formulaic but also praised the melody of the title track and mcdonalds singing voiceon march 5 2021 mcdonald announced that he would again be departing lonestar to pursue a career as a member of the frontmen which also consists of former little texas lead singer tim rushlow and restless heart lead singer larry stewart mcdonald was succeeded by drew womack the former lead singer of sons of the desert as lonestars new lead vocalist in 2023 the band announced they would begin a new tour with womack and would also release a new album titled ten to 1 this album will feature all of the bands greatest hits rerecorded with womacks vocals the first such rerecording of amazed was issued in march 2023early on the bands sound drew from honkytonk and neotraditional country influences but shifted more toward a country pop sound with subsequent albums erlewrine noted in a review of lets be us again that toward the end of the 90s lonestar decided to move firmly into the mainstream of contemporary country leaving behind any hardcore country influences they may have had in favor of sweet anthemic ballads and poppy countryrockers he had previously compared their debut album to merle haggard and george jones while a review of the same in country standard time said that the band seemed very similar to shenandoah — energetic and fun but not spectacular the same review praised the same album for having clever wordplay on no news and prominent fiddle and steel guitar on runnin away with my heart allmusic writer thom owens found the second album veering toward smooth eaglesinfluenced contemporary country of lonely grill erlewine also stated that lonestar began as a fairly straightahead country band indebted to pure honky tonk with their second record they moved themselves toward pop and ironically it didnt pay off in great dividends even if it spawned a top 10 single for their third album lonely grill they take a middle ground moving back toward hardcore country while retaining elements of the pop sheen of crazy nights that albums amazed also became a popular choice for fans to play at their weddings while also becoming their first song to enter adult contemporary playlistsdinoia noted that im already there continued to emphasize the bands focus on passionate ballads as exemplified by amazed while jeffrey b remz of country standard time described the same albums sound as satisfactory music that is squarely in the country light category but never really goes beyond that he also noted in a review of lets be us again that the big sound achieved on that album and the ones immediately before it was the result of huffs production style for the coming home album the band members said that they wanted to achieve a sound with more edge and less influenced by such ballads as is typical of country music bands most of their albums featured session musicians instead of having the individual members play most of the instruments themselves new country magazines review of their debut album criticized the bands sound for this reason while andrew w griffin of country standard time also noted the effect on the bands overall sound mcdonalds voice made lonestar its a good voice full of passion and countryembracing enthusiasm as for his band mates lonestar relied way too much on sidemen to have developed a discernible sound of their ownmcdonald competed on one episode of the television game show wheel of fortune recorded at the grand ole opry house in nashville and aired in february 2003 the episode was part of a special week that paired contestants with country music singers who made donations to charity equivalent to their respective contestants winnings for his episode mcdonald donated to habitat
