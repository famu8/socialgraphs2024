of its debut album safe at home parsons joined the byrds in early 1968 and played a pivotal role in the making of the sweetheart of the rodeo album a pioneering country rock album and a seminal progressive country recording after leaving the group in late 1968 parsons and fellow byrd chris hillman formed the flying burrito brothers in 1969 the band released its debut the gilded palace of sin the same year the album was well received critically but failed commercially after a sloppy crosscountry tour the band hastily recorded burrito deluxe parsons was fired from the band before the albums release in early 1970 parsons spent the first half of 1971 with keith richards of the rolling stones living in his french villa nellcôte during the recording sessions for exile on main street though he contributed very little to the recording process itself after traveling around britain with friends in late 1971 he was treated for heroin addiction and returned to the us where he was introduced to emmylou harris who assisted him on vocals for his first solo record gp released in 1973 although the record received enthusiastic reviews it failed to chart his health deteriorated due to several years of drug abuse foreshadowing his death from a toxic combination of morphine and alcohol in 1973 at the age of 26 a posthumous solo album grievous angel peaked at number 195 on the billboard chartparsonss relatively short career was described by allmusic as enormously influential for country and rock blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other he has been credited with helping to found the country rock and altcountry genres his posthumous honors include the americana music association presidents award for 2003 and a ranking at no 87 on rolling stones list of the 100 greatest artists of all timeingram cecil connor iii was born on november 5 1946 in winter haven florida to ingram cecil coon dog 1917–1958 and avis née snively connor 1923–1965 the connors normally resided at their main residence in waycross georgia but avis returned to her hometown in florida to give birth she was the daughter of citrus fruit magnate john a snively who held extensive properties in winter haven and in waycross grams father ingram connor ii was a famous world war ii flying ace decorated with the air medal who was present at the 1941 attack on pearl harbor biographer david meyer characterized these parents as loving he wrote in twenty thousand roads that they are remembered as affectionate parents and a loving couplehowever he also notes that unhappiness was eating away at the connor family avis suffered from depression and both parents were alcoholics ingram connor ii died by suicide two days before christmas in 1958 devastating the 12yearold gram and his younger sister also named avis avis grams mother subsequently married robert parsons who adopted gram and his sister they took his surnamegram parsons briefly attended the prestigious bolles school in jacksonville florida before transferring to the public winter haven high school after failing his junior year he returned to bolles for a time the family found a stability of sorts they were torn apart in early 1965 when robert became embroiled in an extramarital affair and avis heavy drinking led to her death from cirrhosis on june 5 1965 the day of grams graduation from bollesas his family was disintegrating around him parsons developed strong musical interests particularly after seeing elvis presley perform in concert on february 22 1956 in waycross five years later barely in his teens he played in rock and roll cover bands such as the pacers and the legends headlining in clubs owned by his stepfather in the winter havenpolk county area by the age of 16 he graduated to folk music and in 1963 he teamed up with his first professional outfit the shilohs in greenville south carolina heavily influenced by the kingston trio and the journeymen the band played hootenannies coffee houses and high school auditoriums as parsons was still enrolled in prep school he performed with the group only in select engagements forays into new york city where parsons briefly lived with a female folk singer in a loft on houston street included a performance at floridas exhibition in the 1964 new york worlds fair and regular appearances at the café rafio on bleecker street in greenwich village in the summer of 1964 although john phillips an acquaintance of shiloh george wrigley arranged an exploratory meeting with albert grossman the impresario balked at booking the group for a christmas engagement at the bitter end when he discovered that the shilohs were still high school students following a recording session at the radio station of bob jones university the group reached a creative impasse amid the emergence of folk rock and dissolved in the spring of 1965despite his middling grades and test scores parsons was admitted to harvard universitys class of 1966 on the basis of a strong admissions essay or more likely because his family was wealthy—his grandfather owned onethird of all the citrus orchards in florida although he claimed to have studied theology an oblique reference to his close friendship with his residential tutor harvard divinity school graduate student jet thomas in subsequent interviews parsons seldom attended his general education courses before departing in early 1966 after one semester he did not become seriously interested in country music until his time at harvard where he heard merle haggard for the first timein 1966 he and other musicians from the boston folk scene formed a group called the international submarine band after briefly residing in the kingsbridge section of the bronx they relocated to los angeles the following year following several lineup changes the band signed to lee hazlewoods lhi records where they spent late 1967 recording safe at home the album contains one of parsons bestknown songs luxury liner and an early version of do you know how it feels which he revised later in his career safe at home would remain unreleased until mid1968 by which time the international submarine band had broken upthe international submarine band appeared in the peter fonda film the trip 1967 as a performing band in one of the clubs their song lazy days was offered for the films soundtrack however the soundtrack was later done by mike bloomfields electric flag in 1967 peter fonda had befriended parsons through actor brandon de wilde during this time fonda had recorded a version of the parsons song november nights titled november night dropping the s the song was released as a single in march 1967 featuring november night on the aside with the bside being a version of donovans catch the windby 1968 parsons had come to the attention of the byrds bassist chris hillman via business manager larry spector as a possible replacement band member following the departures of david crosby and michael clarke from the group in late 1967 parsons had been acquainted with hillman since the pair had met in a bank during 1967 and in february 1968 he passed an audition for the band being initially recruited as a jazz pianist but soon switching to rhythm guitar and vocals as wellalthough parsons was an equal contributor to the band he was not regarded as a full member of the byrds by the bands record label columbia records consequently when the byrds recording contract was renewed on february 29 1968 it was only original members roger mcguinn and chris hillman who signed it parsons like fellow new recruit kevin kelley was hired as a sideman and received a salary from mcguinn and hillman in later years this led hillman to state gram was hired he was not a member of the byrds ever he was on salary that was the only way we could get him to turn up however these comments overlook the fact that parsons like kelley was given equal billing alongside mcguinn hillman and kelley on the sweetheart of the rodeo album and in contemporary press coverage of the bandbeing with the byrds confused me a little i couldnt find my place i didnt have enough sayso i really wasnt one of the byrds i was originally hired because they wanted a keyboard player but i had experience being a frontman and that came out immediately and being a very perceptive fellow saw that it would help the act and he started sticking me out front—gram parsons reflecting on his time with the byrdssweetheart of the rodeo was originally conceived by band leader roger mcguinn as a sprawling double album history of american popular music it was to begin with bluegrass music then move through country and western jazz rhythm and blues and rock music before finally ending with the most advanced for the time form of electronic music however as recording plans were made parsons exerted a controlling influence over the group persuading the other members to leave los angeles and record the album in nashville tennessee along the way mcguinns original album concept was jettisoned in favor of a fully fledged country project which included parsons songs such as one hundred years from now and hickory wind along with compositions by bob dylan woody guthrie merle haggard and othersrecording sessions for sweetheart of the rodeo commenced at columbia records recording studios in the music row area of nashville on march 9 1968 midway through the sessions moved to columbia studios hollywood los angeles they finally came to a close on may 27 1968 however parsons was still under contract to lhi records and consequently hazlewood contested parsons appearance on the album and threatened legal action as a result mcguinn ended up replacing three of parsons lead vocals with his own on the finished album a move that still rankled parsons as late as 1973 when he told cameron crowe in an interview that mcguinn erased it and did the vocals himself and fucked it up however parsons is still featured as lead vocalist on the songs youre still on my mind life in prison and hickory windwhile in england with the byrds in the summer of 1968 parsons left the band due to his concerns over a planned concert tour of south africa and after speaking to mick jagger and keith richards about the tour he cited opposition to that countrys apartheid policies there has been some doubt expressed by hillman over the sincerity of parsons protest it appears that parsons was mostly apolitical although he did refer to one of the younger africanamerican butlers in the connor household as being like a brother to him in an interview during this period parsons became acquainted with mick jagger and keith richards of the rolling stones before parsons departure from the byrds he had accompanied the two rolling stones to stonehenge along with mcguinn and hillman in the english county of wiltshire immediately after leaving the band parsons stayed at richards house and the pair developed a close friendship over the next few years with parsons reintroducing the guitarist to country music according to stones confidant and close friend of parsons phil kaufman the two would sit around for hours playing obscure country records and trading off on various songs with their guitarsreturning to los angeles parsons sought out hillman and the two formed the flying burrito brothers with bassist chris ethridge and pedal steel player sneaky pete kleinow their 1969 album the gilded palace of sin marked the culmination of parsons post1966 musical vision a modernized variant of the bakersfield sound that was popularized by buck owens amalgamated with strands of soul and psychedelic rock the band appeared on the album cover wearing nudie suits emblazoned with all sorts of hippie accoutrements including marijuana tuinal and seconalinspired patches on parsons suit along with the parsonshillman originals christines tune and sin city were versions of the soul music classics the dark end of the street and do right woman the latter featuring david crosby on high harmony the albums original songs were the result of a very productive songwriting partnership between parsons and hillman who were sharing a bachelor pad in the san fernando valley during this period the atypically pronounced for parsons gospelsoul influence on this album likely evolved from the ecumenical tastes of bassist chris ethridge who cowrote hot burrito no 1 and hot burrito no 2 with parsons and frequent jamming with delaney bonnie and richards during the albums gestationoriginal drummer eddie hoh best known for his work with the monkees and al kooper proved to be unable to perform adequate takes due to a substance abuse problem and was dismissed after two songs leading the group to record the remainder of the album with a variety of session drummers including former international submarine band drummer jon corneal who briefly joined the group as an official member appearing on a plurality of the tracks and popeye phillips of dr hook the medicine show before commencing live performances the group ultimately settled upon original byrds drummer michael clarke technically different in comparison to his predecessors clarkes striking physical appearance proved to be the primary criterion in this decision an associate of the band would later recall that the burritos had to be pretty and corneal didnt fit from that standpointwhile unsuccessful from a commercial standpoint the album was measured by rock critic robert christgau as an ominous obsessive tongueincheek countryrock synthesis absorbing rural and urban traditional and contemporary at point of impact embarking on a crosscountry tour via train as parsons suffered from periodic bouts of fear of flying the group squandered most of their money in a perpetual poker game and received bewildered reactions in most cities parsons was frequently indulging in massive quantities of psilocybin and cocaine so his performances were erratic at best while much of the bands repertoire consisted of vintage honkytonk and soul standards with few originals perhaps the most successful appearance occurred in philadelphia where the group opened for the reconstituted byrds midway through their set parsons joined the headline act and fronted his former group on renditions of hickory wind and you dont miss your water the other burritos surfaced with the exception of clarke and the joint aggregation played several songs including long black veil and goin backthe flying burrito brothers appeared at the sky river rock festival near sultan washington at the end of augustafter returning to los angeles the group recorded the train song written during an increasingly infrequent songwriting session on the train and produced by 1950s rb legends larry williams and johnny guitar watson despite a request from the burritos that the remnants of their publicity budget be diverted to promotion of the single it also flopped during this period ethridge realized that he did not share parsons and hillmans affinity for country music precipitating his departure shortly thereafter he was replaced by lead guitarist bernie leadon while hillman reverted to bassby this time parsonss own use of drugs had increased so much that new songs were rare and much of his time was diverted to partying with the stones who briefly relocated to america in the summer of 1969 to finish their forthcoming let it bleed album and prepare for an autumn crosscountry tour their first series of regular live engagements in over two years as the stones prepared to play the nations largest basketball arenas and early stadium concerts the burritos played to dwindling nightclub audiences on one occasion jagger had to beseech parsons to fulfill an obligation to his group as parsons became a trustfund baby when he came of age he was still receiving about 30000 per year equivalent to 210000 in 2018 from his family trust during this period distinguishing him from his many hungry hardscrabble peershowever the singers dedication to the rolling stones was rewarded when the burrito brothers were booked as one of the acts at the infamous altamont music festival playing a short set including six days on the road and bony moronie parsons left on one of the final helicopters and attempted to seduce michelle phillips six days was included in gim me shelter a documentary of the eventwith mounting debt incurred am hoped to recoup some of their losses by marketing the burritos as a straight country group to this end manager jim dickson instigated a loose session where the band recorded several honky tonk staples from their live act contemporary pop covers in a countrified vein to love somebody lodi i shall be released honky tonk women and larry williams bony moronie this was soon scrapped in favor of a second album of originals on an extremely reduced budgetfaced with a dearth of new material most of the album was hastily written in the studio by leadon hillman and parsons with two gilded palace of sin outtakes thrown into the mix the resulting album entitled burrito deluxe was released in april 1970 although it is considered less inspired than its predecessor it is notable for the parsonshillmanleadon song older guys and for its take on jagger and richards wild horses the first recording released of this famous song parsons was inspired to cover the song after hearing an advance tape of the sticky fingers track sent to kleinow who was scheduled to overdub a pedal steel part although kleinows part was not included on the released rolling stones version it is available on bootlegs ultimately—and to the chagrin of hillman who was not keen on the song amid the bands creative malaise—jagger and richards consented to the cover versionlike its predecessor burrito deluxe underperformed commercially but also failed to carry the critical cachet of the debut disenchanted with the band parsons left the burritos in mutual agreement with hillman who was long fatigued by his friends unprofessionalism under hillmans direction the group recorded one more studio album before dissolving in the autumn of 1971in a recent interview with american songwriter chris hillman explained that he greatest legacy of the flying burrito brothers and gram is we were the alternative country band we couldnt get on country radio and we couldnt get on rock radio we were the outlaw country band for a brief periodparsons signed a solo deal with am records and moved in with producer terry melcher in early 1970 melcher who had worked with the byrds and the beach boys was a member of the successful duo bruce terry also known as the rip chords the two shared a mutual penchant for cocaine and heroin and as a result the sessions were largely unproductive with parsons eventually losing interest in the project terry loved gram and wanted to produce him but neither of them could get anything done recalled writer and mutual friend eve babitz long lost the tapes from this session have gathered a legendary patina writes david meyer the recording stalled and the master tapes were checked out but there is conflict as to whether gram or melcher took themhe then accompanied the rolling stones on their 1971 uk tour in the hope of being signed to the newly formed rolling stones records by this juncture parsons and richards had mulled the possibility of recording a duo album moving into villa nellcôte with the guitarist during the sessions for exile on main street that commenced thereafter parsons remained in a consistently incapacitated state and frequently quarreled with his girlfriend aspiring actress gretchen burrell eventually parsons was asked to leave by anita pallenberg richards longtime domestic partner decades later richards suggested in his memoir that jagger may have been the impetus for parsons departure because richards was spending so much time playing music with parsons rumors have persisted that he appears somewhere on the legendary album and while richards concedes that it is very likely he is among the chorus of singers on sweet virginia this has never been substantiated parsons attempted to rekindle his relationship with the band on their 1972 american tour to no availhe returned to the us for a oneoff concert with the burritos and at hillmans request went to hear emmylou harris sing in a small club in washington dc they befriended each other and within a year he asked her to join him in los angeles for another attempt to record his first solo album it came as a surprise to many when parsons was enthusiastically signed to reprise records by mo ostin in mid1972 the ensuing gp 1973 featured several members of elvis presleys tcb band led by lead guitarist james burton it included six new songs from a creatively revitalized parsons alongside several country covers including tompall glasers streets of baltimore and george jones thats all it tookparsons by now featuring harris as his duet partner toured across the united states as gram parsons and the fallen angels in february–march 1973 unable to afford the services of the tcb band for a month the group featured the talents of coloradobased rock guitarist jock bartley soon to climb to fame with firefall veteran nashville session musician neil flanz on pedal steel eclectic bassist kyle tullis best known for his work with dolly parton and larry coryell and former mountain drummer nd smart the touring party also included gretchen parsons—by this point extremely envious of harris—and harris young daughter coordinating the spectacle as road manager was phil kaufman who had served time with charles manson on terminal island in the midsixties and first met parsons while working for the stones in 1968 kaufman ensured that the performer stayed away from substance abuse limiting his alcohol intake during shows and throwing out any drugs smuggled into hotel rooms at first the band was underrehearsed and played poorly however they improved markedly with steady gigging and received rapturous responses at several leading countercultural venues including armadillo world headquarters in austin texas maxs kansas city in new york city and liberty hall in houston texas where neil young and linda ronstadt sat in for a filmed performance according to a number of sources it was harris who forced the band to practice and work up an actual set list nevertheless the tour failed to galvanize sales of gp which never charted in the billboard 200for his next and final album 1974s posthumously released grievous angel he again used harris and members of the tcb band for the sessions the record generally received more enthusiastic reviews than its predecessor gp although parsons only contributed two new songs to the album in my hour of darkness and return of the grievous angel he was reportedly enthusiastic with his new sound and seemed to have finally adopted a diligent mindset to his musical career limiting his intake of alcohol and opiates during most of the sessionsbefore recording parsons and harris played a preliminary fourshow minitour as the headline act in a june 1973 warner brothers country rock package with the new kentucky colonels and country gazette a shared backing band included former byrds lead guitarist and kentucky colonel clarence white pete kleinow and chris ethridge on july 15 1973 white was killed by a drunk driver in palmdale california while loading equipment in his car for a concert with the new kentucky colonels at whites funeral parsons and bernie leadon launched into an impromptu touching rendition of farther along that evening parsons reportedly informed phil kaufman of his final wish to be cremated in joshua tree despite the almost insurmountable setback parsons harris and the other musicians decided to continue with plans for a fall tourin the summer of 1973 parsons topanga canyon home burned to the ground the result of a stray cigarette nearly all of his possessions were destroyed with the exception of a guitar and a prized jaguar automobile the fire proved to be the last straw in the relationship between burrell and parsons who moved into a spare room in kaufmans house while not recording he frequently hung out and jammed with members of new jersey–based country rockers quacky duck and his barnyard friends and the protopunk jonathan richman the modern lovers who were represented by former byrds manager eddie ticknerin 1967 nancy ross gave birth to grams daughter polly parsonsin 1971 after leaving the stones camp parsons married gretchen burrell gretchen lisl berrill parsons carpenter at his stepfathers new orleans estate allegedly the relationship was far from stable with burrell cutting a needy and jealous figure while parsons quashed her burgeoning film career many of the singers closest associates and friends claim that parsons was preparing to commence divorce proceedings at the time of his death the couple had already separated by this pointparsons and burrell enjoyed the most idyllic time of their relationship in the second half of 1971 visiting old cohorts like ian dunlop and familyblind faithtraffic bassist ric grech in england with the help of grech and one of grechs friends who also dabbled in country music and is now known as hank wangford parsons eventually stopped using heroin a previous treatment suggested by william burroughs proved unsuccessfulbefore formally breaking up with burrell parsons already had a woman waiting in the wings while recording he saw a photo of a beautiful woman at a friends home and was instantly smitten the woman in the photo was margaret fisher a high school sweetheart of the singer from his waycross georgia days like parsons fisher had drifted west and became established in the bay area rock scene a meeting was arranged and the two instantly rekindled their relationship with fisher dividing her weeks between los angeles and san francisco at parsons expensein the late 1960s parsons became enamored of and began to vacation at joshua tree national park then a national monument in southeastern california where he frequently used psychedelics and reportedly experienced several ufo sightings after splitting from burrell parsons often spent his weekends in the area with margaret fisher and phil kaufman with whom he had been living scheduled to resume touring in october 1973 parsons decided to go on another recuperative excursion on september 17 accompanying him were fisher personal assistant michael martin and martins girlfriend dale mcelroy kaufman later said that parsons attorney was preparing divorce papers to serve to burrell while parsons remained in joshua tree on september 20during the trip parsons often retreated to the desert while the group visited bars in the nearby hamlet of yucca valley on both nights of their stay parsons consumed large amounts of alcohol and barbiturates on september 18 martin drove back to los angeles to resupply the group with marijuana that night after challenging fisher and mcelroy to drink with him fisher disliked alcohol and mcelroy was recovering from a bout of hepatitis he said ill drink for the three of us and proceeded to drink six double tequilas they then returned to the joshua tree inn where parsons purchased morphine from an unknown young woman after being injected by her in room 1 he overdosed fisher gave parsons an icecube suppository and later a cold shower instead of moving parsons around the room she put him to bed in room 8 and went out to buy coffee in the hope of reviving him leaving mcelroy to stand guard as his respirations became irregular and later ceased mcelroy attempted resuscitation her efforts failed and fisher watching from outside was visibly alarmed after further failed attempts they decided to call an ambulance parsons was declared dead on arrival at yucca valley hospital at 1215 am on september 19 1973 in yucca valley the official cause of death was an overdose of morphine and alcoholaccording to fisher in the 2005 biography grievous angel an intimate biography of gram parsons the amount of morphine consumed by parsons would be lethal to three regular users keith richards stated in the 2004 documentary film fallen angel that parsons understood the danger of combining opiates and alcohol and should have been more cautious upon parsons death fisher and mcelroy were returned to los angeles by kaufman who dispersed the remnants of parsons drugs in the desertbefore his death parsons said he wanted his body cremated at joshua tree and his ashes spread over cap rock a prominent natural feature there however parsons stepfather bob organized a private ceremony back in new orleans and neglected to invite any of his friends from the music industry two accounts state that bob parsons stood to inherit grams share of his grandfathers estate if he could prove that gram was a resident of louisiana explaining his eagerness to have him buried thereto fulfill parsons funeral wishes kaufman and a friend stole his body from los angeles international airport and in a borrowed hearse they drove it to joshua tree upon reaching the cap rock section of the park they attempted to cremate parsons body by pouring five gallons of gasoline into the open coffin and throwing a lit match inside what resulted was an enormous fireballthe two were arrested several days later since there was no law against stealing a dead body they were only fined 750 for stealing the coffin and were not prosecuted for leaving 35 pounds 16 kg of his charred remains in the desert what remained of parsons body was eventually buried in garden of memories cemetery in metairie louisianathe site of parsons cremation is today known as the cap rock parking lot a local myth brings parsons fans out to a large rock flake known to rock climbers as the gram parsons memorial hand traverse this myth was popularized when someone added a slab that marked parsons cremation to the memorial rock the slab has since been removed by the us national park service and relocated to the joshua tree inn there is no monument at cap rock noting parsons cremation at the site joshua tree park guides are given the option to tell the story of parsons cremation during tours but there is no mention of the act in official maps or brochures fans regularly assemble simple rock structures and writings on the rock which the park service periodically removesstephen thomas erlewine of allmusic describes parsons as enormously influential for both country and rock blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other his influence could still be heard well into the next millennium in his 2005 essay on parsons for rolling stone magazines 100 greatest artist list keith richards notes that parsons recorded music output was pretty minimal nevertheless richards claims that parsons effect on country music is enormous and adds that this is why were talking about him nowin 2003 the americana music awards awarded the late gram
